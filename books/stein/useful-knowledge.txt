RIVERS
It is the happy lot of the publisher to entertain from
time to time a manuscript which because of its inherent
significance or its literary importance he feels to have a
special and perhaps a permanent value for the world, but
which he also feels is not likely to appeal in the first in-
stance to the wider reading public. That the discriminat-
ing may the more readily learn of these notable occasions,
Messrs. Payson & Clarke Ltd., propose to mark such of
their works as seem to possess these attributes with the de-
vice shown above, a symbol of the Two Rivers of Manhat-
tan. The first editions of these books will be necessarily
small and will be distinguished from possible subsequent
editions by exceptional physical qualities. This volume,
“Useful Knowledge " by Miss Gertrude Stein, is the first
of the Two Rivers books which Messrs. Payson & Clarke
Ltd., have the honour to publish.

Writing about Americans comes to be very much what is
natural to any one thinking that it is pleasant to be one.
America is interesting because they will come to like a pleas-
ant thing as they have come to be one. And every little helps.
And Useful Knowledge has been put together from every
little that helps to be American. Once in talking and saying that
in America the best material is used in the cheapest things be-
cause the cheapest things have to be made of the best material
to make them worth while making it, it is really that it has come
to be a romantic thing that has been so added to the history of
living for a whole generation. It is. Romance is everything and
the very best material should make the cheapest thing is mak-
ing into living the romance of human being.
This is the American something that makes romance every-
thing. And romance is Useful Knowledge.
Useful Knowledge is pleasant and therefore it is very much
to be enjoyed. When there are many Americans and there are
there is a great deal of pleasure in knowing that not only do
they differ from one another but that Iowa and California are
very pleasant and very different from one another.
And then this further, when they are altogether and ten years
older and ten years younger they own the earth just as pleas-
antly as ever. It is nice to own the earth just as pleasantly as
ever and to have Iowa and California and New York and
Florida be different from one another.
Any one wishing to add a state can add one.

Introducing
One was a completely young one and this one was very
clearly understanding this thing, clearly understanding that
this one was a young one then and this one was one very
clearly explaining this thing to every one and some indeed
quite a number listened to him then and some of those lis-
tening were young ones then and some of those listening
then were not young ones then.
The one who was completely a young one was one certainly
very clearly then understanding this thing and quite clearly
explaining this thing and explaining this thing clearly and
quite often.
This one was one who was doing something and another
thing and another thing and in a way he was doing each
thing in the same way as he was doing each other thing and
in a way there were differences and in a way certainly there
were not any differences at all. He was a young one and he
was clearly understanding this thing and he was certainly
often very clearly explaining this thing. He was doing
something and he certainly did it for sometime and it was
certainly something he should then be doing. Some one
might be thinking that he might be more successfully than
doing some other thing but really not any one thought he
should not be doing the thing he was doing when he was do-
ing the thing and certainly he was very steadily doing the
thing, the thing he was doing when he was doing that thing.
In a way he had been doing a number of things, in a way he
was always doing the same thing. He was a young one and
he was completely clearly understanding this thing and he

was completely when he was explaining this thing com-
pletely clearly explaining this thing.
He certainly was understanding something. He certainly
was understanding and clearly explaining being a young
one in his being a young one. Certainly he was listening and
listening very often. Certainly he was understanding some-
thing, he was clearly understanding his being then a young
one. He certainly was listening very much and very often.
He certainly was sometimes explaining something. He cer-
tainly was clearly explaining his being a young one, he cer-
tainly was clearly understanding and clearly explaining this
thing.
He could certainly pretty clearly ask what was the meaning
of anything he was hearing. He certainly could ask quite
clearly what was the way that something could come to
have the meaning that thing had in being existing. He could
almost completely clearly ask about something that some
one had been explaining. He could completely clearly ask a
question, he could almost completely clearly then ask an-
other question, he could not quite completely clearly ask
another question about that thing, he certainly could not
completely clearly ask a question then again, ask another
question then. He could certainly completely clearly ex-
plain being a young one in being then a young one, he cer-
tainly could completely clearly explain this thing, he cer-
tainly could completely clearly understand this thing.
He certainly did do a thing and go on sometime and go on
and steadily go on doing that thing and certainly he did be-
gin getting to explain quite clearly why he was doing that
thing, what he was doing then, what he was not doing then.
Certainly he did then explain quite clearly about his doing
that thing and he was then certainly completely steadily
doing that thing. He was quite steadily doing that thing, he

certainly was quite completely then understanding his
doing that thing, he certainly was very steadily doing that
thing. He certainly was very steadily doing another thing
then, he certainly quite completely understood his doing
that thing then, he certainly quite completely and clearly
understood his doing that thing then. He certainly did that
thing very steadily then. He certainly quite completely
clearly understood his doing that thing then. He certainly
did another thing then, he certainly quite steadily quite en-
tirely steadily did that thing then. He certainly quite clear-
ly understood his doing that thing then. He certainly very
steadily did that thing then. He certainly quite completely
understood his doing that thing then. He certainly did an-
other thing then. He certainly very steadily did that thing
then. He certainly quite completely, he certainly quite
clearly understood his doing that thing then.
He certainly did listen and listen again and again, he cer-
tainly quite steadily did this thing. He certainly quite
clearly asked a question then. He certainly did sometimes
quite clearly ask another question then. He did certainly
sometimes did and quite clearly ask another question
then, and certainly then he commenced listening again and
he went on then listening and he continued then being
listening.
He certainly was not ever about the same thing asking the
same question again. He certainly was listening again to the
same thing, he certainly was not asking the same question
about the same thing again. In a way then he was not one
asking the same questions again and again. He certainly was
not asking the same question about the same thing and he
certainly was one understanding clearly his being a young
one and he certainly was quite often quite clearly explain-
ing this thing and he was doing something and he was com-

pletely steadily doing that thing and he was completely
clearly understanding his doing that thing. He certainly did
amuse some and he certainly did interest some and he cer-
tainly did not disappoint some and he certainly did go on
being living and certainly he did quite clearly understand
being a young one in being a young one and he certainly
did very nearly completely clearly and quite often explain
this thing to some who were and to some who were then
not themselves then young.

Farragut or A Husband's Recompense
In anticipation.
Baking.
This is breathing.
Neglected.
What.
Half.
In anticipation.
Caesar drinking.
What.

In anticipation hearing what, hear.
In anticipation.
What happened.
When.
In the year 1877 when there was a resolution there was
quicker travelling. It was listening then and jealous feeling.
On the part of whom.
Listening.
They came to bathe that day.
Any day was the principal day. Every day was beside it be-
side that circumstance the circumstance that kept it abso-
lutely evaded.
Oh dear.
Farragut.
At home in Italy.
Why were they at home in Italy. Because of here.


## p. 6 (#20) ###############################################

Why were they at home in Italy. Because the youngest was
three years old. Tall. Blessed and useful.
What could they do. They didn't leave it.
It came then. What.
Stretching
Stretching what.
Stretching everything.
For what.
For returning.
Where did they return.
They did not return.
Anyway.
How do you do.
Very well I thank you.
Early years.
Not alone oh no not alone. Not visited. By this blessing.
They wouldn't have been useful. They wouldn't have been
useful but they would have been necessary. It was neces-
sary that they should be together by shoes.
They came to raffle this later. Not really. It was very hard
to lose their mother-in-law.
Hard.
Almost impossible.
Earlier years.
I really ought not to bake apples and seed raisins and have
fowls and be bewildered. I really ought to smile. I can re-
member how astonishing it was to be so actively sweet that
I promised to see a lemon orchard. I remember it very well.
We put them all into cigar boxes.
We have no way of being surprised.
Dictionaries were not a surprise.
I don't believe there was any water. If there had been why
didn't we go swimming together. I don't believe either that


## p. 7 (#21) ###############################################

there was any sun. Grass had that way about it and after-
wards when the wind blew I knew I was a protection. What
did I protect I protected icing. In what way was there
icing. There was icing because there was indivisible union.
I don't want any remarks. l'have a selfish way of saying, tell
me how I love you.
Grammar.
Grammar was a festival.
So was spelling
So was permission.
So was it all.
I have started permission.
Please be neat.
Please be complete.
Please guess fingers.
Which is it.
The fourth.
Which is it now.
The first.
Which is it now.
The third.
Which is it now.
The little one.
Now you guess.
Which is it now.
The third.
No the fourth.
Which is it now.
The second.
No the fourth.
Which is it now.
The third.
No the fourth.


## p. 8 (#22) ###############################################

Which is it now.
The fourth.
No the third.
Which is it now.
I don't want to guess any more.
Recently there was a change in furniture. The leading diffi-
culty had always been that in sitting there was no recog-
nition of clarification of clarification of sliding. This did
not seem an instance of the era of good feeling.
I want to know now how often it had been neces-
sary to copy all the special ways of sitting. I want to
know how obliging every one is. This has nothing to do
with us.
Crossing.
What was crossing.
The boat.
Where was it going.
It wasn't going it was coming.
When did it come.
It came on time.
When it came there did not happen to be there any one to
meet it. This was not an oversight. This was not negligence,
it was not meant to show slight, it was not meant to be care-
less. It made meeting exciting. Exciting to whom. Exciting
to those being ones being exciting.
I was naughty.
To whom.
I was there.
When.
When I was there.
I was there all the time.
When was I there.
I was there when I was there.


## p. 9 (#23) ###############################################

I was there all the time.
When was I there.
I was there all the time.
I was there all the time.
The first thing I saw was an explosion. An explosion of
what of retaliation.
There was no need to question. Every one was pleased.
Two bits worth of birthday.
I was born at eight o'clock.
This morning when I woke up it was I made that mistake
it was eight o'clock.
Were you pleased.
I was.
I am now going to begin telling everything.
Shoving.
What is shoving.
It is not the expression of opinion.
It is not lightning.
It did not happen at first.
Just at first there was a dispute. Should one wait when
one said one was waiting. Should one say one was waiting.
Would it seriously threaten any one to be cowardly to offer
to write and say something. Was it careless of a friend to
insist on selecting what was powerless to influence. I wish I
had a handkerchief.
This is entirely a different manner.
Shouting.
What is shouting.
It is a disease. Is there any way to stop it. There is a way and
that way was the way that was shown to be their way. Dear
things.
Leave it to me to explain what happened.
I can't remember the detail. The first that I can remember


## p. 10 (#24) ##############################################

is asking do you mean to deny that you heard me. I asked
that often. The next thing that I remember is asking were
you nervous again. The next thing that I can undertake to
be remembering is were you flattering. Were you flattering
me by voicing an objection. If so don't bother.
I don't really mean to be a slave.
In the morning I don't really mean in the morning.
What is penetrating.
Plants are penetrating.
I am going to be happy in winter.
So it's natural is it. Well it's quite what it should it should
be natural and it is natural and that doesn't interfere with
it in any way in respect to its being great literature.
Naturalness. What is naturalness, it is suggesting that pearls
are shouting and treasures are kissing and ears are engaging
and roses are prominent and eyes are speckled and foreheads
are soft and hair is massive and a chin makes a whole. A
whole what, a whole recreation.
I say I wished that I was there and I was there. I say I wish I
was here and I am here.
I say that I shouted.
I say that I offered odours. I say that special sights are spe-
cial sights.
What are powerful oats.
When she came there was grain.
I misjudged her, I said I could never picture her physical
presence. I said I thought she had gone to see a plaster house.
She hadn't. She hadn't been anywhere. She had just come.
The first time I saw her was the day we met, by that I mean
they were sitting, where were they sitting, they were sit-
ting by their side. I don't mean to be foolish.
Suddenly I remembered. It was clear. It was quite clear.
Did it do that. I asked some one. He said that it had been
10


## p. 11 (#25) ##############################################

SS
as
that way, that he had experienced everything, that fog was
penetrating and moisture was lonesome and darkness was
appalling. I said I didn't believe it.
What is success.
Success is what she was supposed to favour. How was she
supposed to favour success. She was supposed to favour
success by being fond of money. Whatever she said was ear-
nest and thoughtful and showed rare decision. By that I
mean Monkey. Monkey see monkey do. Monkey do what.
Monkey loves me.
I stopped it. I said not so sweet. I did think I had that re-
sponsibility. I knew a better way to be a fourth way. I said
didn't Henry and Herbert love you.
I will never be better again. Surely surely I shouldn't
wonder.
Principal parts.
All parts are principal parts. Birthdays are saints days.
Does any one know when. By this yes. That winters and
summers and some days all days are refreshing. Does any
one know when why is it. By this means we conquer.
I don't think you can say this is too natural.
To go on with my story, by the time we were settled well
we didn't settle easily, we had to decide what rights were
willing. Were they willing, well I guess yes. This is the way
it happened. Where shall I put my shoes. Where shall I put
my shoes. Don't repeat it.
Where shall I put my shoes. I didn't expect you to put
your shoes. Where shall I put my shoes. I don't think it's at
all funny. I don't think I am willing to put my shoes where
I am not to put them and I don't think that I will wait. I
will put my shoes among shoes. Some call them boots. By
this I mean that little ways have an end. They will be
changed. By this I mean that little ways have an end. They

will be changed. They will see to that and by this time I
conquer.
So then accrediting moving.
I don't like rain. I don't mean that thunder scares me. You
know very well what I mean I mean that sometimes I wish
I was a fish with a settled smelling center. I don't like it. I
think it's an ugly word.
How well I remember the quarrel. I don't often mention
such things. They never can happen. But once it was very
suddenly authentic.
I learned to say doesn't it fatigue you. I learned not to be
ceremonious. I learned correct snatches.
Sometimes when it was warm, I came suddenly, I came sud-
denly to be there and to be exciting. It was worse than
money.
Alright I will be natural.
B is for birthday baby and blessed.
S is for sweetie sweetie and sweetie.
Y is for you and u is for me and we are as happy as happy
can be.
Returning to mutton that is to say to mention reforming.
What a cake. What a kindness. What a smell. What
a shame. What a slight. What a sound. What a universal
shudder. I will not be coerced. But I was. Was I. I was
coerced. I see it.
I began by saying that I had plenty of time and that I knew
best. I said more things Sunday. Not Sunday to-day.
Perhaps that is too natural. The emphasis can be where you
like.
If you had read the word the other way I wouldn't have
minded.
I have forgotten what was mentioned.
A scene I remember very clearly was when we were coming

## p. 13 (#27) ##############################################

W
home and we had no time to settle what we would tell was
the reason that we were expected. No I don't like spending
my time saying that we were so slovenly.
Reading.
Is reading painful.
When one has not the habit of reading reading is not pain-
ful. One can read hands, one cannot compare that with
reading a book. Either the one or the other is useful and
both are so pleasing to the ear and eye.
I have the eye but not the hand of an artist.
Calling out loud. Were you worried when they decided that
silver was Italian. I knew jolly well that you weren't and
it was foolish to leave me and hear it. Italian was silver of
course Italian was silver. I mean that it was a wonderful
resemblance. One morning and the evening before I argued
with leaning very well, I argued about reverberating, I ar-
gued about pealing, I argued about challenges and repeti-
tions and sorrows and shawls and lined leather coats and
parts of examples and repeated leopards and collars and
astonishing reasons. I argued before.
I remember a feather. I don't mean the three, I couldn't re-
member no I couldn't remember how beautiful and curlily
the rose feather and the shape to a feather could come to-
gether. A shape to a feather can come together. Violets and
salt water.
Two and three quarters, two and a quarter two and a half.
Two and three quarters, two and a half two and a half.
Two and a half, two, two.
Two and a half one and a half one and a half.
I don't know the other.
Please be with me.
Black lines and sun make a change of night gear.
We went and bought flannel.

There is a slight difference only it is very difficult.
They were friends of him.
They were friends of him.
If possession means importance. They were friends for him.
They were friends of him.
His means holding it.
Two were friends of him..
I wrote it on blue paper to remind him of the blue vase.
This is serious.
I have to think.
To-night when we were sitting there I was asked if I meant
to continue as I had been continuing or if I meant to com-
mence again. Did I answer.
Whispering by command.
I can't remember all of it.
The first day that Leonard went away it was very consider-
ate of him. I remember all about sleeping. I remember all
about awaking. I remember thinking do we mean to be
serious. Do we mean to idolise. Do we secrete anything. I re-
member thinking and not being vague. Resolution is not
formidable. Then it was rather absurd of us to tell some one
that she must do it she must do it she must do it. The
thing that I remember that was most amusing and most
learned was that there were pins for us all. Dear pins. How
easily we were pleased.
It isn't difficult to please us.
Fourteen.
Fourteen.
Roses.
When I was wishing and sitting I wished for a clock. I
meant to pick out an expensive one. I did so and now dear
one is economising. That isn't right. I meant it is right. I
mean it is right for bathing in one. It is right to be econo-
14


## p. 15 (#29) ##############################################

mising. It is right for dear one to be economising. And some
day we will be rich. You'll see. It won't be a legacy, it won't
be selling anything, it won't be purchasing, it will just be
irresistible and then we will spend money and buy every-
thing a dog a Ford letter paper, furs, a hat, kinds of purses,
and nearly something new that we have not yet been care-
ful about. This is natural. Very natural.
We won't keep any letters of Frank's .
I remember another thing. We were walking and all of a
sudden there was oiling, I mean a little oil was forming, it
had formed on the chin. I had been told that there was
something and I was suspicious of this thing and I was mis-
taken.
I said go home if you like.
I said I was an authority.
I said I could be angry.
I said nothing.
We went on terrorising.
Then we came to a hill.
We settled on the hill.
I said is it likely that I am stubborn.
An answer.
Not such as would be given.
There came to be then a time when answering was every-
thing. Yes. When saying, I am going to speak first, is
nothing.
It has no success.
It isn't shattering.
Please prepare me.
I want to be lovely and then. I want to be lively and then.
I want to be lively and then I say isn't it fortunate that we
were early, that I was severe that I meant all I said. I want
to be early and lively. I want to be especially adapted. I am
allo Wel,

clean and concise and I estimate everything at their value.
I am not in a hurry.
It was natural.
Mike said they ate themselves up.
It was natural
It is natural to me.
Look
At
Me
I can read that we are all fat.
We are the lovely pair of.
I remember that we came to stay at the place where water
was drunk. We all said it was necessary. It was a mistake.
We drove her to it but I will not mention another one.
Finally.
Finely.
Finally we had an unpleasant time about the letters. We
were all mistaken. It wasn't true at all.
I made that wish.
When we went to Spain we never expected to hear about
Italy.
It was not a surprise.

PART TWO
How Farragut Reformed Her and How She Reformed
Him. “Ob that frightens me.”
I like it.
I am not complaining.
The whole title of the second part is. They don't frighten
me. Yes they do though. We don't have to go right on we
wait until inspiration overtakes us. You are so distinguished.
I'll go on both sides hereafter. Indeed you ought to I should
say.
Which is rather out of the way period.

which he will recognise again as he occupies as he succes-

The Difference Between the Inhabitants of France and the
Inhabitants of the United States of America
are
There is a difference between France and the United States
of America in the character of their inhabitants. There is
this difference between France and the United States of
America in the character of its inhabitants. The inhabitants
of the United States of America have this quality in their
character in reference to drama that the things they do and
the thing that they do do are such things that when they are
young are different than when they are older. For instance
when they are young and violent, then when they are
young and then when they are violent and when they are
not young and when they are not young are they not young
and not as violent. Drama consists and in this they are so
they are so certainly restricted, restricted to that themselves
and not any more so. Thank you is not mentioned. In
France especially so and for this reason especially when they
are young and as an example not at all exacting not at all
as exacting and when they are young and not any more so
not feverishly so not as exacting exactly and as an instance
and in collusion and not in very nearly as many cases
secondary. The need of thanking for this is taught by de-
scription.
Five examples of each will be given.
Five examples of each will be given so that the difference
will be as well understood as ever. As ever and so much and
so forth for nearly and very nearly all the same in a minute

and as connected for it is as it shall should or may be yes.
May be it may be as yes as yes so there and so there would
have been some noise to-day.
In the beginning did she know her that is to say as she was
away from home and as she was away from home did she
know her. This makes fountains remain with her too with
her too. No one need decide whether it is or is not used by
the ones sending or whether in order that the ones sending
are able to send whether it is necessary to send then before-
hand a written address arranged in the fashion that is habit-
ual and expected by the employees who will have to handle
it in the ordinary course of the arrangement. And a letter
follows when an envelope and a stamp have both been given
and at the request of the giver thanked for. After that we
change to America and those who are very much older and
have had really have had an entirely different experience
not only with all of it but with very much else. In both
cases handkerchiefs and Easter and in the one case as a gift
and in the other case as reception and careful conditions.
Conditions carefully conditions as carefully as carefully as
conditions and as ever.
This is the story of an American. An american formerly
known as meant as much as that formerly known every-.
where where he had been as having been seen often
can not replace it all alone and not any more. The
reason given is that when can there be a change, changes
and occupation. Occupied too. This makes the meaning of
what he meant when he had four or five four or
five what.
This is the story of a friendship, two sons two and two
sons, a man as two and two sons, and a man and as two
and two sons. They had neither of them any reason to come
again soon. This made it so prettily as an order. Order it.

## p. 45 (#59) ##############################################

No one sees more than it for distribution. No, no women.
No.
Begin again fairly well. An American woman means that
she is to say have it, have it, four four and why should
four and four why should four and four and why should
four and four, fear, four and four, fear.
The frenchwoman comes away, comes away, fifteen
fifteen has never meant that, sixteen has never meant that
seventeen has never meant that, if as presents, if as presents
easter and if as presents. Hopes to stay.
How many examples make addition subtraction division
and long division. To continue as advised.
Another case of a frenchman. A frenchman has had an
arrangement that makes it possible that he should
read and what should he read. He should read and write.
What should he read and write. He should read and
write and recite. What should he read and write and
recite.
Another case is the case of that American the American of
whom it is said can he say so. This American of whom it is
said can he say so says practically that he practically says
that he unites windows and windows when windows and
windows are in their place and he wishes to stop that is to
remain where he is.
The example of the American lady who has a fan is the one
selected for admiration in the same way the example of the
french lady who has a fan is the one selected as the one to
be chosen to be an example of an admirable frenchwoman.
The next example that is to be noted is that of the french
family who nearly came too late for the festival. Every one
asked was the celebration as pleasant as it could be and
they were all there.
The American family needed no more, no one needed any
45


## p. 46 (#60) ##############################################

more nothing more was needed really nothing more was
needed at all. All of them and so forth and very kindly. Will
they kindly say so also.
The next example is easily disposed of in this way there is
no difference.
The next example may not be used to be used, the next ex-
ample may be used to show that an aunt and two nieces
say that they may make up their minds to stay the nieces
may make up their minds to stay and the aunt may make
up her mind to let them stay and they may or they may not
be asked to stay. Anyway the decision has cost them noth-
ing and so forth. This is principally from them and by
them and in a way for them and perhaps beside them. This
is in a way before them.
The other example American example the other examples
the American example is this both nieces and their aunt
have been separated for some time and quite naturally they
do not ask it of each other and if so it is refused. There is
always some reason given.
More examples make all of it necessary. The difference
between the examples is this, one example shows this and
the same example never shows anything else. Another ex-
ample shows something else and in this way something is
proved. Approved by all.
A Finish.
More difference the more difference it makes the less trouble
there is in making any reference to it.
The trouble with it is that they may be mistaken. The
marriage and it is a marriage may mean more. Having met
and having met the man and having met the man there he
might say that he had never heard of it and he might say
that when he heard of it he said that he had not heard of it
before. This makes it all the more this makes all the more


## p. 47 (#61) ##############################################

mar-
and as this makes it all the more as much so. Formerly and
formally, formally and formerly does it mean that indeed
as they said she had not thought so.
On the other side as another side this is the other side. If
the man should assume that he was to be married would his
brother write to him as his father would have written to
him. And would the wife say that her husband had written
to his brother as the father would have written to the
brother and would he. The occasion did not arise as the
brother remained unmarried married again. Another case is
this, the father and the mother had a son. The son was
young and when he was old enough he married and as his
father and his mother said it might easily be that the mar-
riage would be satisfactory.
The American case is this. The father and the mother had
not denied it to any one. No one need wonder. And no
wonder was and it was no wonder that they all felt that
children had that privilege and did not need to remember
how often everything was heard. They heard it said.
To say we will wait, to say we wait, waiting for recog-
nition. Take this case. Not excited about that. Take that
case. No excitement in that. In that case there is no excite-
ment in that case. That makes what one can out of every-
thing.
The American has nearly five has nearly five has more

The American has expected recognition.
The difference between there is a difference between, what
is the difference and their difference, to add to them to be
added to them, to divide from them to be divided from
them, to be sent away by them and if sent away by them
would they be willing are they willing have they spoken of
it and have they acted in a way to make it at all likely that
they would be prepared to have it happen. This is partly a
beginning.
For any other reason there is more of this for a reason,
there is more of this for this reason and for the rest of the
time as well.
Thought of it, they thought of it, as they thought it as
they thought of it as well.
They thought of it as well and very nearly always for this
and on this account. No change was made.
Change it for one change it as perhaps may be necessary.
They changed it and they changed it.
Change it in a family early way. This is an example. Three
months is an example. This is an example. At the end of
three months is an example. This is an example as the three
months are more than ended it is an example.
The Americans have heard they have heard the Americans
and they have heard, the American has heard as the Ameri-
can has heard this.

Three Leagues
A LEAGUE
Why don't you visit your brother with a girl he doesn't
know.
And in the midst of emigration we have wishes to bestow.
We gather that the West is wet and fully ready to flow.
We gather that the East is wet and very ready to say so.
We gather that we wonder and we gather that it is in re-
spect to all of us that we think.
Let us stray.
Do you want a baby. A round one or a pink one.
MORE LEAGUE
A vote all around
A coat all around
A leather pin and a dusty hat
We refuse, I refuse.
Some surprise a word. Some surprise a third.
Is there a mother
Is there a cousin.

He bows his head and then he is dead.
We meet reluctantly with opposition.
We hope that every one will be satisfied with themselves.
We believe in further wishes.

Not in haste not in haste not in haste slowly, not in pearls.
Braids are straight and we ate sacks and sacks of corn.
Look and listen to the sea, see what we can never see, sea for
me, see for me look and illustrate the sea.
The sea comes from Boston to China and Japan. It comes
from inland and from the top. It causes catarrh.
Not a saleable surface, a surface that is rigid is ruined and
a surface that is certain is cloudy and a surface that is missed
is widowed and a surface that is mild is raised and a surface
that has nights is harmless and a surface that meadows is
gracious and a surface that is loosed is smiling and a surface
that is mine is mine. And where do you mind what you hear.
Leaves of distress leave distress a mess, leave a mess for mess
distress. Can not you think and swim.,
I cannot make the sound of her voice I cant make the sound
of her voice I cannot make the sound of her voice. Arise
and sit and message.
What does a message say. A message does not say I pray, I
pray that you may have come to-day. A message does not
say, what does she say.

Were you expectant, were they expectant were they
expecting women.
And what is nervousness. We understand speeches and re-

We understand so much.
She, she cannot be me, she is the center of the sleeve, I am

package under one arm and a black package under the
other arm and dressed in brown with a white blouse, the
second Saint Joseph the third a hunter in a blue coat and
black garters and a plaid cap, a fourth a knife grinder who
is full faced and a very little woman with black hair and a
yellow hat and an excellently smiling appropriate soldier.
All these as you please.

that it was the principal recreation and they were so ar-

were given away.

They have not seen them here again.

Accuse me I accuse myself of earnestness of appreciation of
reason and of learning. I do not vary in growth. I am not
torn by age. How young am I.

Did he emerge then. He did and we do not credit the
moment when one may be tall. There are different youths.
Some grow tall. All are tall. In some there is no succession of

The scene of the future. Can you wish that jelly, can you
wish that jelly. Can you wish that jelly can be eaten with
cream.
The sense of the past.
When they are young they can see that the world is around.

Consider matters.
The happiness of the future.

There is a singular fertility in he recognises. There is a

An Instant Answer or A Hundred Prominent Men
IS.
What is the difference between wandering behind one
another or behind each other. One wandered behind the
other. They wandered behind each other, they wandered
behind one another.
Kings counts and chinamen.
A ſevival.
I will select a hundred prominent men and look at their
photographs hand-writing and career, and then I will
earnestly consider the question of synthesis.
Here are the hundred.
The first one is used to something. He is useful and available
and has an unclouded intelligence and has the needed con-
tact between Rousseau and pleasure. It is a pleasure to read.
The second one and in this case integrity has not been wor-
shipped, in this case there has been no alternative.
The third one alternates between mountains and moun-
taineering. He has an anxious time and he wholly fails to
appreciate the reason of rainfall. Rainfall sometimes lacks.
It sometimes is completely absent and at other times is
lacking in the essential quality of distribution. This has
spread disaster.
The fourth one illustrates plentifully illustrates the at-
tachments all of us have to what we have. We have that
and we are worried. How kind of you to say so.
The fifth one of the fifth it has not been said that there
have been three told of the gulf stream and the consul.

Frank, where have you been. I have not been to London to
see the queen.
The sixth one the sixth one thoroughly a pioneer. He is
anchored we do not speak of anchor nor of diving he is
readily thoughtful. He has energy and daughters. How
often do we dream of daughters. How often. Just how
often.
The seventh is mentioned every day.
The eighth. Can you pay the eighth to-day. Can you delay.
Can you say that you went away. Can you colour it to
satisfy the eye. Can you. Can you feel this as an elaborate
precaution. Can you.
The ninth one is vague. Is he vague there where they care
to insist. Is he vague there or is he inclined to tease. Is he
inclined to tease. We know what we show. A little quarter
to eight. I hope you will conduct him to his seat. He does
not need politeness. No and he tells you so. No.
The tenth one the tenth one feels traces of terror. This does
not sound wealthy nor wise nor does he plan otherwise. He
planned very well. There is always this to tell of him. He
can be a king or a queen or a countess or a Katherine Susan.
We know that name. It has always been the same. At the
same time every one shows changes. We arrange this at
once.
The eleventh. Who won you. That is very sweet. Who were
you. Expected pages and word of mouth, and by word of
mouth. Expect pages and by word of mouth. Who won
one. Who won won. Mrs. Mrs. kisses, Mrs. kisses most.
Mrs. misses kisses, misses kisses most. Who won you.
And the twelfth. The twelfth was the man who restrained
Abel and Genoa. Why do the men like names. They like
names because they like calling. A calling is something to
follow. We no longer represent absence. I call you. Hullo

Thirteen, the thirteenth has not neglected the zenith. You
know how to invent a word. And so do you. You know how
to oblige him with lilacs. And so do you, you know you do.
And you know how to rectify an expression. Do you build
anew. Oh yes you do.
The fourteenth prominent man is prominent every day of
the year. Do you feel this to be at all queer. He is promi-
nent and eminent and he is personally severe. He is not
amiable. How can an amiable baby pronounce word. How
can they be predominant. We know why we have reason we
reason because of this.
The fifteenth is wholly exhilarated. Place air and water
where they are.
The sixteenth yes indeed. Have we decreed. Yes indeed.
Have we. Do we need that.
The seventeenth. The seventeenth century is older than
w much older. A century older. Or older
than a century older. The seventeenth is a century older is
older than a century older than the sixteenth.
The eighteenth one wishes to annex the Philippines.
The nineteenth one mingles with men. We say he mixes
with men. We say he mixes up nothing. He does not mix
things up nor does he do the opposed thing. When he does
ring and he does ring, what, that is what he says, what.
What does he say. He says what did I say. He says. Did I
ring. I say, he says, I say did you say anything. How clev-
erly brothers mingle. We haven't forgotten.
The twentieth. No one forget anything and he does not
forget anything. He does not forget anything when he is
here. Does he forget to come again. He does not elaborate
exercises. There are witnesses there.

The twenty-first nursed what was to him beaming. I can
declare that they are not aware of seeming to share polic-
ing. They have increased the number of police in New
York.
The twenty-second, how many more days are there in Sep-
tember than there were. This question has been aroused by
the question asked by the prominent man who is the sub-
ject of the declaration that words may be spoken.
The twenty-third is not indicated by invasion. We all
believe that we do invade islands countries homes and
fountains. We do believe that the hierarchy of repetition
rests with the repeaters. Now we severally antedate the
memory. Do you relish powder.
Of the twenty-fourth it has been said that out of sight
out of mind is not so blind. Please do not wave me away.
Waves and waves they say carry wood away. Carry, does
that remind you of anything.
The twenty-fifth is moderately a queen. What did you say.
Anger is expressive and so are they.
The twenty-sixth has many ordinary happinesses. He is
ordinarily in the enjoyment of his challenge. Do not chal-
lenge him to-day. What did you say. Do not challenge him
to-day.
The twenty-seventh does measure very well indeed the
heights of hills. How high are they when they are negli-
gible. How high are they any way and where do dogs run
when they run faster and faster. And why do dog lovers
love dogs. Do you know everything about deer. He had a
father and they made a window and windows have never
been scarce.
The twenty-eighth is perceptibly loving. He has invented
perfumes and portraits and he has also reconciled stamina
with countenance. I do say that yesterday he was very

not say that it is wonderful to be loaned at all.
The twenty-ninth neglects the history of a mute.
Mute and unavailing. The twenty-ninth does not add
considerably to his expense. He is not needed there.
Where is he needed. He is needed here and there. Drive
me there.
The thirtieth manages to be lavish. He washes land and
water, washes them to be green, wishes them to be clean, his
daughter merits her mother and her sister her brother.
He himself witnesses this himself and he carries himself by
special train. A train of cars. Will there soon be no trains
of cars. Did you hear me ask that. Will there pretty soon be
no bridling.
The thirty-first remembers that a pump can pump other
things than water and because of this he says miles are
astray. They have proof of this. Can you solidly measure
for pleasure.
The thirty-second is an irresistible pedestrian. He has much
choice, he chooses himself and then his brother and then he
rides back. He can seem in a dream and he can uncover the
lover. I have been so tender to-day.
The thirty-third is incapable of amnesty. Forgive me for
that you dear man. Where were you born. I was born in
a city and I love the whole land.
The thirty-fourth is second to none in value. Why do you
value that more. Why do you value you value that any
more.
The thirty-fifth why can there be naturally this one who
has found it invigorating to exchange beds for beds and
butter for butter. Exchange butter for butter. Do ex-
change more beds for more beds.
The thirty-sixth has heard of excitement. How can you be
148

excited without a reason. How can you be an adaptable
tenth. He is in the tent. There is a tent there.
The thirty-seventh for the thirty-seventh a great many tell
the truth, they tell the truth generously. Somebody is gen-
erous there where the rest of them care. Do they care for
me. Do they. How awfully popular I am.
The thirty-eighth has held enough and he holds the rest
there where there are no more edible mushrooms. Do you
know how, to tell an edible mushroom. Have you heard all
of the number of ways.
The thirty-ninth is contented and alarmed. Why do you
share and share alike and where do you share what you
share. What do you care.
The fortieth is rapidly rained on. Rain is what is useful in
Europe and not necessary where you have irrigation. Do
you understand me. And why do you repeat what you say.
I like to repeat what I say.
The forty-first one did he duck. Did he say I wish they
would go away, did he describe himself, did he feel that he
was married, did he entertain on next to nothing
and did he furnish houses and did he candidly satisfy
enquiries. Did he learn to quiet himself. Did he resemble
ready money and did he inquire where they went. How
can all shawls be worn all the time. Some say it is very
fine to-day.
The forty-second what did you say, the forty-second
came every day and yet how can he come every day when
they are away. He comes anyway and he replaces what he
uses and he uses it there and he promises to share what he
has and he is very prominently there. We stay home every
day when he comes here. I don't quite understand, I am a
little confused. Does he come every day.
The forty-third one is the one that has inevitably estab-
wa

lished himself in the location which is the one that was
intended as the site of the building. Did they build there.
No certainly not as he had already arranged it for himself.
I understand. He came first. Yes he came first and he stayed
which was quite the natural thing for him to do.
The forty-fourth one married again. No one meant to
come to the wedding absolutely no one and he said I am
marrying and they said who is it to be and he said I know
what you believe and they said how can you believe that
you are to be married again. What is the marriage cere-
mony that you refer to. I refer to the marriage ceremony
Is that so.
The forty-fifth, all the immediate present and those
immediately present, all those present will please answer
that they are present now. And what do they all say. All
those who are present say so. We were very nearly pioneers
in this movement. And why are you so frequently referred
to, because when they refer to me they mean me.
The forty-sixth prominent man is the one who connected
them to their country. My country all the same they have
their place there. And why do you tell their names. I tell
their names because in this way I know that one and one
and one and one and one and one and one and one and one
and one and one and one and one and one and one and one
and one and one and one and one and one and one and one

and one and one and one and one and one and one and one
and one and one and one and one and one and one and one
and one and one and one and one and one and one and one
make a hundred. It is very difficult to count in a foreign
language.
The forty-seventh does do what he expected to do. He
expected to have what he has include what he was to have
and it did and then when he went again he went again and
again. After that all the same he said all the same I am very
well satisfied.
The forty-eighth placed them there. Where did he place
them. Exactly what do you mean by placing them, he was
asked and he answered. I placed them and they were
equally distant from the different places that were near
them. Is this the way you choose a capital they said. Yes
indeed he said, that is as you may say the result of the
influence of Spanish. Oh yes they replied not entirely
understanding but really he was right. He was undoubtedly
in the right.
The forty-ninth, what habits had this one formed, you may
say that he can be mentioned as being the one who was
bestowed again and again on elephants and mosses. It is
queer that fountains have mosses and forests elephants.
And why is it astonishing that we have heard him when he
was mentioning that he went there, we do not know. Show
me he said and they opened their eyes. Why do you stare,
and why did they. We do not care. Yes do please me. We
please ourselves.
The fiftieth, why did you expect me. We expected you be-
cause you had announced yourself and you are usually
punctual. How did you learn to be punctual. Because we
have had the habit of waiting for the rain. Does that make
one punctual. It does. This is what has been bought. Buying

is a vindication of roads. But and stay, stay and buy. By and
by. Yes Sir.
The fifty-first one has to say what do you command. What
is sweating, that is what I like says Mike, the fifty-first one
has an understanding of resisting. He had it said of him that
he could countenance alarmingly the destruction of a con-
dition. Why are conditions connected with what I have not
said. I said the account, was there an account of it on
account of it.
The fifty-second has as an established fact the fact that
the account given is the one that makes him furnish every-
thing. Did he furnish it all and was it wise to apprise him
that there were many who had religiously speaking an in-
terest in interpretation. This sounds like nonsense. What do
you mean by spiritual, what do you. Mike said what do you
mean by spiritual what do you. They wished to say that
they did not wish anything tried again and again. Be rested.
You be rested.
The fifty-third have you heard that fifty and fifty are
evenly divided. Have you heard about the way they say it.
All of them come again and say it. We say it and they say it.
May we say it. I have not forgotten that the fifty-third
prominent man is the one that has the most anxious air.
The fifty-fourth one is the one that has been left to study
industrialism. No one asks is there merit in that. No one
says that there is something noble in that. No one says how
do you study a subject. No one idolises Frank. Don't they
indeed.
The fifty-fifth is very pretty in any language. How do you
do is one way of looking at it. He minds it the most and the
shape of it very much. He is very easily offended and he
believes in a reference. I refer to you and to you and to you.
I always refer to you. I refer to you and I refer you to him

and I refer her to them and they refer them to me. Can you
see why. Do you understand why they have no need to go
and come, to sit down to get up and to walk around.
The fifty-sixth measures what he has done by what he
will do. He measures it all and means to react. Action
and reaction are equal and possible and we relieve the
strain. In this way we arrange for hope and pleasure. This
is what we say unites us all to-day.
The fifty-seventh is admirably speaking radiant when he
has no annoyances. And why does he continue to know that
a lieutenant colonel is in command. Why does he know it.
Dear me why does he know it.
The fifty-eighth one is alright. How do the hours come
to be longer. Longer than what, longer than English
french, Italian, North and South American Japanese and
Chinese.
The fifty-ninth marries when he marries, and he is married
to me. Do not fail to see him and hear him and rehearse
with him and molest him. He has an organic wit.
The sixtieth is actually rested. He has come to be reasonably
industrious. He had and he has come to be reasonably in-
dustrious. In this way he is successful.
The lieutenant colonel was found dead with a bullet in
the back of his head and his handkerchief in his hand.
The sixty-first one has had a very astonishing career. He
said that he would never mention another and he never
did, he also foresaw the re-establishment of every crisis and
he went ahead he went in and out and he foresaw that
youth is not young and that the older ones will not seem
older and then he imagined expresses. In this way he estab-
lished his success. I have not mentioned his name.
The sixty-second was just the same. He entered and he
came and he came away and no one cared to share expenses.
153


## p. 154 (#168) ############################################

No one cared to share expenses. What did you say. No one
cared to share expenses. He was privileged to increase paler
nights and he always measured investigation. How can you
investigate privileges. By not curtailing expenses. Thank
you for all your thoughts. Give your best thoughts. Thank
you for all your thoughts.
The sixty-third, we all have heard of regiments called the
sixty-third. Reform regiments in time and they have
magnificent beginnings. Do not reform them in time and
they progress fairly. Do not reform them at all and they
will not necessarily decrease. I say the sixty-third one is the
one who came to be celebrated because of this. Because of
this he came to be the one that one of the ones that are
mentioned in this list.
The sixty-fourth we are a nation of sixty-fourth. Do you
remember how a great many of them sat together. Do you
and do you remember what they said. My impression was
that they had not spoken. My impression was that they had
not spoken then. Never again. It is hard to love your
father-in-law. Hard almost impossible.
The sixty-fifth, there is a standard for the sixty-fifth. This
is his standard. He comes to it and he is very well indeed. Is
he. Yes he is very well indeed.
The sixty-sixth, how are you when you are steady. He
steadily repeats himself. Do you mean he allows you to
feel that he does so. He does indeed.
The sixty-seventh has this advantage. It is an advantage
that is easily enjoyed.
The sixty-eighth all small culmination meets with this as
their reward. We reward when and where we reward and
we reward with rewards. And this is the use of a guardian,
where it is guarded it is as well guarded as ever.

was able to arrange for everything again and again and he
said with hesitation why do I like to make sweets. Sweets
to the sweet said some one.
The seventieth come again and listen were the origin and
the beginning of his success. Come again and do not go
away. Come again and stay and in this way he succeeded.
He was successful. Have you meant to go away he would
say. Oh no indeed he meant to stay they would say. And
he meant to stay. He was successful in his heyday and he
continued to be successful and he is succeeding to-day.
When you say how can you feel as you feel we say, that is
the way to succeed. That is just the way to succeed. He
says I have succeeded.
The seventieth do I remember whether I do or I don't.
I think I usually do that is to say I always have. Does that
mean you always will. I think so. I gather from what I saw
at the door that you wanted me to come in before.
The seventy-first believe me at first. At first we believed
that that was because they were so many that had been equal
to this one. And then we accompanied them. They were
not regularly identified. Nor was he, why did he and be-
cause, why did he, because he did double the pansies. You
understand that this is symbolical. No one has really more
than doubled the pansies.
The seventy-second for in this way there is a second the
seventy-second managed to see me. And where were they
all. They were all in there. And why did no one declare
themselves faultless. This was very nearly a dish, a nest of
dishes. Do you remember that play. A nest of dishes. This
and the painting of a garden scene made an astonishing
measure for measure. Answer blindly to this assurance
and be assured that all the pleasure is yours.
The seventy-third has nearly spoken. He said I see rapidly

I compose carefully, I follow securely and I arrange dex-
terously, I predict this for me.
The seventy-fourth how often have both had children. I
said that he should not change he should continue with
girls. I said she should not change she should continue with
girls. She changed and he did not. He continued with girls.
The seventy-fifth very many actually count. They count
one two three four five six seven.
The seventy-sixth one is the one that has not often met nor
often been met nor very often met them yet. They are
there they do declare that they are there. And why publish
data.
The seventy-seventh really places it. He places there with
a great deal of care. And when he was twelve he sang in
public. There are a great many reasons for it. This is one
of them. The reason I have given is their reason. Do be
satisfied with their reason. Do not be worried do not be
worried at all nor do not be at all worried. Be satisfied. Be
very well satisfied.
The seventy-eighth do you remember about him do you
really explain when you explain that he loved lacing and
unlacing and releasing and separate silence. Do you really
credit this with that. Do you do so fairly.
The seventy-ninth was originally delicious, delicious as
delicious as the excellent repast which was offered. Do you
remember how she wrote offer, offered. Do you and do you
prefer exchange that is barter to pleasure in reason. I be-
lieve in pleasure and the reason the reason for it.
The eightieth how do you manage to mention a number
separately. It is a specialty a specialty of wine. That is very
fine in you and it all proves to me that I have faith and a
future.
The eighty-first at first the eighty-first was the one who

had made the fruit house who had the fruit house made
there where it was very singular that he could understand
that there was land.
You see it is like this land is made to be near by so that one
can see it. Land is made to be understood to be there. So
there was naturally no distribution of land and land. Do
you understand, Lizzie do you understand. These were
naturally there here there and everywhere. We have princi-
pally met whether we need to or not. I do complain of sit-
ting there. Not here. No not here.
The eighty-second, was it we say was it by means of a
hammer or by means of a rock, was it by hammer or by
rock that we felt that the future was one with the present,
Do you know by what means rockets signal pleasure pain
and noise and union, do you know by what means a rock
is freed when it is not held too tightly held in the hand.
Many hold what they hold and he held what was best to
settle in Seattle. Why do you care for climate. Why do you.
I know.
The eighty-third, tell me about him. I will. He was never
neglected nor was he especially willing to sing, a great many
ceased to secure singing. You mean they found Saturday
intolerable. That is just it that is just what I wish to say,
you put it in that way and certainly very certainly a great
many kind of birthdays are taken, for granted. Granted.
The eighty-fourth that too might be taken to be the same
as if it were one number the more and yet if you think
delicately and you do think so you will see why I say no it
is not the same. Now supposing he were famous would he
understand it as you say he does understand fame. Would
he. Oh you question me so narrowly and I might say I didn't
mean and then what would you say. I would say I just
want to be praised. There that is permanent.

## p. 158 (#172) ############################################

The eighty-fifth is the one did I mention that this too
might be the number of a regiment. You see they say that
there are more there you mean as to one thousand and four
thousand, there are more there.
He has given as the reason that he knows the difference be-
tween Christmas New Year Easter and Thanksgiving. He
has given this as a reason.
The eighty-sixth is the one to measure by animals. A dog
another dog and a woman two lions and a man a central
surface a lion a dog and a man and two men and more
introduction. I introduce you to him and to him. Do you
introduce him too often. I do not think so. No I do not
think so.
The eighty-seventh study the eighty-seventh one carefully
and tell me what it is that you notice. I notice that in dif-
ferent positions one sees a different distinction. You mean
you always distinguish him. Oh so readily. And when you
smile does he smile at all, he smiles very readily when you
smile at all. And does he furnish you with agreeable merri-
ment. Very agreeably so. Tell him so it will please him. I do.
I will.
The eighty-eighth furnish the eighty-eighth with the means
of furnishing. We furnish everything. He furnishes every-
thing. In this way we cannot mean what has been made
clear. We cannot mean that he plans this.
The eighty-ninth remember that when you remember the
eighty-ninth it was not so happily bowed to as it might
have been if all pages were printed as they came. We like
printing it all the same. Now just what do you mean by
that. I mean that very rapidly he refreshes himself.
The eighty-ninth, forty made the eighty-ninth clearly the
half of that number. There are a number of them aren't
they and each one every one more than one, one and one,

they all stay over there. If for instance there had been one
continuation where then would they place the succession.
Where would they. You don't ask where did they. You
don't really ask me anything.
The ninetieth is the ninetieth one to-day. To-day come
to care to stay. How do you. Dear me how can you use it as
if it was a cane. How can you. Please how can you. I can
do all this and all the time have you discovered anything.
She did, keys and a kitchen. Not a mistake. It was not a
mistake.
The ninety-first who knows about this one, it is not easy
to plan for it, eat for it or trouble for it. It is not easy to
manage to say to-day and yesterday and very likely every
other day. It is not easy. I say it isn't easy.
The ninety-second and does he attend to all of it. Do you
attend to all of it. I am not easily convinced that they
attend to all of it. Do they attend to all of it. All that I
know about it is that whether they do or whether they
do not we have a system of triple mirrors. In this way we
see where they come. Where do they come from. I see
abundance geographically.
The ninety-third, every one has heard of the ninety-third.
Naturally, and now what do you mean by rushing. What
do you mean by rushing in here and saying am I in it.
What do you mean by doing that. Even if you were in it
you would not be heard from so definitely. Be reasonable,
leave it all to me. When this you see remember that you are
to wait for me. I can say this very quickly.
The ninety-fourth marries he marries them, now how can
you know whether in saying this I mean what you mean
does this bother you at all does it annoy you, can you be
obstinate in asserting that we have the same meaning that
you mean and that I mean that he marries them. Think

about this carefully and when you are thoroughly
prepared to be generous give me your answer. I answer
for him.
The ninety-fifth, remember the ninety-fifth. Ninety-nine
is ninety-nine, and the ninety-fifth has a very good evening.
Good evening. It is not our custom to say good evening.
The ninety-sixth and more and more. You were given to
reconciling floods with fire. This is a noisy day. May I look
again.
The ninety-seventh hears me has heard me when I have
said do not care to hear Cornelius Vanderbilt. The ninety-
seventh is excellent in his way, he is very excellent in that
way and does prepare his share. Do you prepare your share.
And do you estimate your share correctly. Have you ever
mistaken anything and put it away there with your share.
No neither of you have, neither of you have ever done so.
The ninety-eighth, the ninety-eighth and the ninety-ninth,
the ninety-eighth is the one we see when we look. We look
and we look. How do we look. We look very pretty. Do
we look well. We look very well.
The ninety-ninth who is the ninety-ninth, as for me I
prefer to call tissue paper silk paper. Do you prefer to do
so by the year. Tissue paper is a thin paper, and silk paper is
a thin paper. One might say that tissue paper is a paper made
of thin tissue. It is sometimes called silk paper. It is made of
the same material but is not quite so thin.

To begin with what did he say. What did he say.
To begin with what they remember.
They remembered that very much and they were nickled
and embroidered. To be nickeled, how do you reveal how
do you dare to presume everything.
Goodness knows.
I can feel that.
They were met by themselves, and suggestions, how eas-
ily they parody suggestions, how easily they parry sug-
gestions.
Cover me they care for me. They care, they do care.
They and they do care.
I do not freely recollect speaking.
When they were there when they were in there he said he
he said of them he did not say this to them, he said to them

why they fasten trees to trees. In our country they do not

I did not hear them at all.
And now I wish to tell exactly how I have been impressed,
I have been very well impressed. For instance memory
and then discussion, analysis and then barter, and did
you feel that when they went further they adven-
tured. To me it really does not seem so. And to them it
does not seem so. They were not at all elevated to this
degree.
They said that they would say so and they said nothing at
all about it they did not carry this there in their favour.
Indeed one might say that they were blameless. They were
more readily not altered. An altar is made by the rest of

There is no flattery in this.
Do you remember how often we had cake. Do you remem-

The cannon of Australia makes a noise and we say and they

thing else is opposed to that. I see why they do not like
noise and make a noise. I know. The reason is this when
they went they were still and still when they were there
they were there, where there, and they knew they heard
that, they hear that they hear that, they do not hear that
they have come there, this they do not hear there, they do
not listen to hear, nor do they hear by ear, listen and you

So there.
Responsibilities are all there, and they are not to be followed
by prayer there, they are to be followed by the songs as
sung. Responsibilities are not to be followed there, they
ought not to be followed there by prayer but they ought
to be followed by the songs as sung, they ought not to be
flung there they ought not to be followed by prayer there.
I know the result I know that result. A responsibility fol-
lowed by another is plenty good enough.
I do not think that all of this is very unpleasant and not
very affable. Do you not feel that way about it. I do come
to think of it. I do come to think of it and there are three
men and one man. We know that together three men and
one man make four men. We know this of them and know-
ing this we can mean that there is one man and that there
are three men and together the three men and the one man
together there are four men and when they say we have a
remarkable opportunity they mean by this an imagination
just as has the president.
He knows everything but the third, third what, but the
third congratulation. Do not mention it by yesterday. Do
not measure by chairs. You know how they sign. They sign
by chairs. And how are hours changed. Hours are changed
by settling this and they say we knew when we came. And
they say the same. In this way we weigh the same. Do you
remember me for this. I do not want to be persistent. I do
not want to have the blame. We can claim that we do noth-
ing for fame.
We can claim we do claim we shall claim shall you claim
what we claim. No. I told you so.
