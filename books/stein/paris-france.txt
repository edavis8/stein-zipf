PART I
paris,franceis exciting and peaceful.
I was only four years old when I was first in Paris
and talked french there and was photographed there
and went to school there, and ate soup for early
breakfast and had leg of mutton and spinach for
lunch, I always liked spinach, and a black cat jumped
on my mother's back. That was more exciting than
peaceful. I do not mind cats but I do not like them
to jump on my back. There are lots of cats in Paris
and in France and they can do what they like, sit on
the vegetables or among the groceries, stay in or go
out. It is extraordinary that they fight so little
among themselves considering how many cats there
are. There are two things that french animals do
not do, cats do not fight much and do not howl much
and chickens do not get flustered running across the
road, if they start to cross the road they keep on going
which is what french people do too.
Anybody driving a car in Paris must know that.
Anybody leaving the sidewalk to go on or walking
anywhere goes on at a certain pace and that pace
B I


## p. 2 (#12) ###############################################

keeps up and nothing startles them nothing frightens
them nothing makes them go faster or slower nothing
not the most violent or unexpected noise makes them
jump, or change their pace or their direction. If
anybody jumps back or jumps at all in the streets of
Paris you can be sure they are foreign not french.
That is peaceful and exciting.
So I was in Paris a year when I was four to five and
then I was back in America. A child does not forget
but other things happen.
A little later in San Francisco there was more french.
After all everybody, that is, everybody who writes
is interested in living inside themselves in order to
tell what is inside themselves. That is why writers
have to have two countries, the one where they
belong and the one in which they live really. The
second one is romantic, it is separate from themselves,
it is not real but it is really there.
The English Victorians were like that about Italy,
the early nineteenth century Americans were like
that about Spain, the middle nineteenth century
Americans were like that about England, my genera-
tion the end of the nineteenth century American
generation was like that about France.
Of course sometimes people discover their own
country as if it were the other, a recent instance of that
2


## p. 3 (#13) ###############################################

is Louis Bromfield discovering America, there have
been a few English like that too, Kipling for instance
discovered England but in general that other country
that you need to be free in is the other country not the
country where you really belong.
In San Francisco it was easy that it should be France.
Of course it might have been Spain or China, but
really in San Francisco as a child one really knew too
much about Spain and China, and France was
interesting while Spain and China were familiar, and
daily. France was not daily it just came up again and
again.
It came up first in such different books, Jules Verne
and Alfred de Vigny and it came up in my mother's
clothes and the gloves and the sealskin caps and muffs
and the boxes they came in.
There was the smell of Paris in that.
And then for quite a long while it was very easy to
forget France.
The next thing I remember about France were the
Henry Henrys and Sarah Bernhardt, the Panorama of
the Battle of Waterloo and Millet's Man With The
Hoe.
The Panorama of the Battle of Waterloo.
One of the pleasantest things those of us who write
or paint do is to have the daily miracle. It does come.
3


## p. 4 (#14) ###############################################

I was about eight years old and it came with the
Panorama of the Battle of Waterloo.
It was painted by a frenchman, I wonder if it would
not be interesting to have one now, one of those huge
panoramas, where you stood in the center on a
platform and all around you on every side of you was
an oil painting. You were completely surrounded by
an oil painting.
It was then I first realised the difference between a
painting and out of doors. I realised that a painting
is always a flat surface and out of doors never is, and
that out of doors is made up of air and a painting has
no air, the air is replaced by a flat surface, and any-
thing in a painting that imitates air is illustration and
not art. I seem to have felt all that very intensely
standing on the platform and being all surrounded by
an oil painting.
And then there was Sarah Bernhardt.
San Francisco had lots of french people in it, and a
french theatre and one naturally knew little girls and
boys who talked french at home quite naturally.
And so when a french actor or actress came to San
Francisco they always stayed a long time.
They liked it there and of course when actresses or
actors stay anywhere they always act, so naturally
there was a great deal of French spoken in the theatre.
4


## p. 5 (#15) ###############################################

It was then that I found out quite naturally, that
french is a spoken language and English a written
one.
In France whenever anybody writes anything and
wants anybody to know what it is like they read it
out loud. If it is in English it is natural to pass the
manuscript to them and let them read it but if it is in
french it is natural to read it out loud.
French is a spoken language English really is not.
Sarah Bernhardt made me see the thin arms of
frenchwomen. When I came to Paris and saw the
little midinettes and Montmartoises they all had them.
It was only many years later when the styles changed,
in those days they wore long skirts, that I realised what
sturdy legs went with those thin arms. That is what
makes the french such good soldiers the sturdy legs,
thin arms and sturdy legs, if you see what I mean,
peaceful and exciting.
That is what makes all the french able to ride up
hill on bicycles the way they do, no hill is so steep
but that slowly pedalling up and up they go, men and
girls and little children, the sturdy legs and thin arms.
The other thing that was french there in San
Francisco were the family of Henry Henrys. That
was their name.
There was a father and mother they were known as
5


## p. 6 (#16) ###############################################

Monsieur and Madame Henry and there were five
children the oldest Henry Henry played the violin
We used to go there in the afternoon and stay to
dinner and then we used to dance the Henry children
and ourselves, to the french music of the violin.
And we always for dinner had a roast of mutton, a
gigot they called it, cooked the same way as when I
went to school in Paris and potatoes in the butter
around it, clean looking potatoes, not so dark as
when they were cooked American. But the thing
that was most exciting were the knives and forks.
The knives had been sharpened so much that the
blade was as thin as a dagger with a slight bend on
top and the forks so light that when you pressed on
them they bent. These knives and forks were the
most passionately french things I knew, I might say
I ever knew.
Then there was Millet's Man With The Hoe.
I had never really wanted a photograph of a picture
before I saw Millet's Man With The Hoe. I was
about twelve or thirteen years old, I had read Eugenie
Grandet of Balzac, and I did have some feeling about
what french country was like but The Man With
The Hoe made it different, it made it ground not
country, and France has been that to me ever since.
France is made of ground, of earth.
6


## p. 7 (#17) ###############################################

When I managed to get a photograph of the picture
and took it home my eldest brother looked at it and
said what is it and I said it is Millet's Man With The
Hoe. It is a hell of a hoe said my eldest brother.
But that is the way french country is, it is ground
like that and they work at it just that way with just
that kind of a hoe.
All this was all the Paris France I really knew then
and then for a very long time I forgot about Paris
and about France.
Then one day when I was at college at RadclifFe in
Cambridge Massachusetts, I was on a train and
sitting next to me was a frenchman. I recognised
him as a visiting lecturer and I spoke to him. We
talked about American college women. Very won-
derful he said and very interesting but and he looked
at me earnestly, really not one of them, now you
must admit that, not one of them could feel with
Alfred de Musset that le seul bien qui me reste au
monde c'est d'avoir quelque fois pleure. I was
young then but I knew what he meant that they
would not feel like that. That and a certain interest
in Zola as a realist but not as much interest as in the
Russian realists was all that Paris meant to me until
after the medical school when I settled down in Paris
France.

PART II
Alice toklas said, my grandmother's cousin's
wife told me that her daughter had married the son
of the engineer who had built the Eiffel Tower and his
name was not Eiffel.
When we were having a book printed in France
we complained about the bad alignment. Ah they
explained that is because they use machines now,
machines are bound to be inaccurate, they have not
the intelligence of human beings, naturally the
human mind corrects the faults of the hand but a
machine of course there are errors. The reason why
all of us naturally began to live in France is because
France has scientific methods, machines and elec-
tricity, but does not really believe that these tliings
have anydiing to do with the real business of living.
Life is tradition and human nature.
And so in the beginning of the twentieth century
when a new way had to be found naturally they
needed France.
Really not, french people really do not believe
that anything is important except daily living and the
8


## p. 9 (#19) ###############################################

ground that gives it to them and defending them-
selves from the enemy. Government has no import-
ance except insofar as it does that.
I remember so well it was during the 1914 war
and they were all french and they were talking about
women voting and one of the women who was
listening said, oh dear I have to stand in line for so
many things coal and sugar and candles and meat and
now to vote, oh dear.
After all it does not make any difference and they
know it does not make any difference.
When I was first in Paris and for many years I had
a servant, we were very good friends her name was
Helene. One day quite accidentally, I do not know
how it happened because I was not at all interested,
I said to her, Helene what political party does your
husband belong to. She always had told me every-
thing even the most intimate troubles with her family
and her husband but when I said that, what party
does your husband belong to, her face grew rigid.
She did not answer. What is the matter with you
Helene I said, is it a secret. No Mademoiselle she
answered it is not a secret but one does not
tell it. One does not tell the political party one
belongs to. Even I have a political party but I do
not tell it.
c 9


## p. 10 (#20) ##############################################

I had been in France many years but I was sur-
prised and I began to ask around and they were all
like that. They all had that same expression of, it is
not a secret but one does not tell it. A son did not
know what party his father belonged to nor the
father the son's.
It is because of this that the recent front commun
had such a short life. They told, they all had to tell
and to tell all day long, what their political party was
and so of course it could not last long. It just could
not.
No, publicity in France is really not important,
tradition and their private life and the soil which
always produces something, that is what counts.
Mrs. Lindberg was in Paris and she and I were
talking. In America of course she had suffered they
had suffered from publicity. In England they had
payed no attention to them but they the Lindbergs
knew and England knew that they were there. In
France they pay attention to you when you meet,
but they do not bother you because in between they
do not know that you are there.
When Fania Marinoff came to Paris she said she
would like to meet so and so. Sorry I said I do not
know them. But you know who they are, oh yes,
I said, vaguely. Then she mentioned others. Some
10


## p. 11 (#21) ##############################################

I knew and some I did not. She could not under-
stand, in New York, she said, if I knew you I would
know them. Yes yes I said but not in Paris. Not to
know the well known in Paris does not argue your-
self unknown, because nobody knows anybody
whom they do not know.
Now for some if not for all these reasons, Paris was
where the twentieth century was.
It was important too that Paris was where fashions
were made. To be sure there were moments when
they seemed to dress better in Barcelona and in New
York but not really.
It was in Paris that the fashions were made, and it
is always in the great moments when everything
changes that fashions are important, because they
make something go up in the air or go down or go
around that has nothing to do with anything.
Fashion is the real thing in abstraction. The one
thing that has no practical side to it and so quite
naturally Paris which has always made fashions was
where everybody went in 1900. They needed the
background of tradition of profound conviction that
men and women and children do not change, that
science is interesting but does not change anything,
that democracy is real but that governments unless
they tax you too much or get you defeated by the


## p. 12 (#22) ##############################################

enemy are of no importance, that is the background
that everybody needed in 1900.
It is funny about art and literature, fashions being
part of it. Two years ago everybody was saying that
France was down and out, was sinking to be a second-
rate power, etcetera etcetera. And I said but I do
not think so because not for years not since the war
have hats been as various and lovely and as french as
they are now. Not only are they to be found in the
good shops but everywhere there is a real milliner
there is a pretty french little hat.
I do not believe that when the characteristic art
and literature of a country is active and fresh I
do not think that country is in its decline. There
is no pulse so sure of the state of a nation as its
characteristic art product which has nothing to do
with its material life. And so when hats in Paris
are lovely and french and everywhere then France
is alright.
So Paris was the place that suited those of us that
were to create the twentieth century art and literature,
naturally enough.
So many things. They change occupations so
easily, they are very conservative very traditional
and they change occupations easily. They may start
as bakers and then they become agent for an estate
12


## p. 13 (#23) ##############################################

and then they become a banker all one man and all
in ten years and then they retire.
It is also amusing that it always takes about seven
men to do anything, to build a whole road or to put
up three telegraph poles or to build a fair or to take
down one tree. It does not make any difference seven
men, thereabout, are always there at it, it takes several
to talk several to look on and one or two to work,
so whatever there is to do it always takes about the
same number. Now this was very important because
once again this made a background of unreality which
was very necessary for anybody having to create the
twentieth century. The nineteenth century knew
just what to do with each man but the twentieth
century inevitably was not to know and so Paris was
the place to be.
And then the way they feel about the dead, it is so
friendly so simply friendly and though inevitable not
a sadness and though occurring not a shock. There is
no difference between death and life in France and
that too made it inevitable that they were the back-
ground of the twentieth century.
Naturally it was foreigners who did it there in
France because all these things being french it made
it be their tradition and it being a tradition it was not
the twentieth century.
13


## p. 14 (#24) ##############################################

There are always so many foreigners everywhere
but particularly in France.
One day Gerald Berners and I were walking and
he suggested that it would make a nice book to put
in it all the aphorisms which were not true.
We thought of a great many and among them,
familiarity breeds contempt and no man is a hero to
his valet. We concluded that in fully ninety per cent
of the cases it was the other way.
Familiarity does not breed contempt. On the
contrary the more familiar it is the more rare and
beautiful it is. Take the quarter in which one lives,
it is lovely, it is a place rare and beautiful and to leave
it is awful.
I remember once hearing a conversation on the
street in Paris and it ended up, and so there it was
there was nothing for them to do, they had to leave
the quarter. There it was, there was nothing else to
do they had to leave the most wonderful place in the
world, wonderful because it was there where they had
always lived.
Paris quarters were like that, we all had our quarters,
to be sure when later we left them and went back to
them they did look dreary, not at all like the lovely
quarter in which we are living now. So familiarity
did not breed contempt.
14


## p. 15 (#25) ##############################################

And then not being a hero to one's valet. Is there
anybody in the world even yourself who is as pleased
with your publicity as your servant certainly your
french servant is pleased there is no doubt about that,
past present and future servants all of them are pleased
with that.
So then which quarters of Paris were important and
when.
From 1900 to 1930, Paris did change a lot. They
always told me that America changed but it really
did not change as much as Paris did in those years
that is the Paris that one can see, but then there is no
remembering what it looked like before and even no
remembering what it looks like now.
We none of us lived in old parts of Paris then.
We lived in the rue de Fleurus just a hundred year
old quarter, a great many of us lived around there
and on the boulevard Raspail which was not even
cut through then and when it was cut through all the
rats and animals came underneath our house and we
had to have one of the vermin catchers of Paris come
and clean us out, I wonder if they exist any more now,
they have disappeared along with the horses and
enormous wagons that used to clean out the sewers
under the houses that were not in the new sewerage
system, now even the oldest houses are in the new
15


## p. 16 (#26) ##############################################

system. It is nice in France they adapt themselves to
everything slowly they change completely but all
the time they know that they are as they were.
Belley the little country town now even all summer
long eats grape fruits, they have concluded that grape
fruits are a necessary luxury.
Our old servant Helene who was with us before
the war for many years, learned from us that children
should be raised differently and more hygienically
and raise it in that way she did but all the same
one day I heard her talking to her six year old little
boy and saying you are a good little boy, yes mother
he said, and you love your mother very much, yes
mother he said, and you will grow up loving your
mother she said, yes mother he said and then she said
you will be grown up and you will leave me for a
woman will you not, yes mother he said.
I always remember too when the Titanic went
down and everybody was so moved at the heroism
and the saving of women and children, I do not see
anything sensible in that, said Helene, what use are
women and children alone in the world, what kind
of life can they lead, it would have been lots more
sensible, said Helene, if they had drawn lots and
saved a certain number of complete families much
more sensible, said Helene.
16


## p. 17 (#27) ##############################################

And that is what made Paris and France the natural
background of the art and literature of the twentieth
century. Their tradition kept them from changing
and yet they naturally saw things as they were, and
accepted life as it is, and mixed things up without any
reason at the same time. Foreigners were not
romantic to them, they were just facts, nothing was
sentimental they were just there, and strangely
enough it did not make them make the art and
literature of the twentieth century but it made them
be the inevitable background for it.
So from 1900 to 1930 those of us who lived in
Paris did not live in picturesque quarters even those
who lived in Montmartre like Picasso and Bracque
did not live in old houses, they lived in fifty year old
houses at most and now we all live in the ancient
quarter near the river, now that the twentieth century
is decided and has its character we all tend to want to
live in seventeenth century houses, not barracks of
ateliers as we did then. The seventeenth century
houses are just as cheap as our barracks of ateliers
were then but now we need the picturesque the
splendid we need the air and space you only get in
old quarters. It was Picasso who said the other day
when they were talking about tearing down the
insalubrious parts of Paris but it is only in the insalu-
D 17


## p. 18 (#28) ##############################################

brious quarters that there is sun and air and space,
and it is true, and we are all living there the beginners
and the middle ones and the older ones and the old
ones we all live in old houses in ramshackle quarters.
Well all this is natural enough.
Familiarity does not breed contempt, anything one
does every day is important and imposing and any-
where one lives is interesting and beautiful. And
that is all as it should be.
So it begins to be reasonable that the twentieth
century whose mechanics, whose crimes, whose
standardisation began in America, needed the back-
ground of Paris, the place where tradition was so firm
that they could look modern without being different,
and where their acceptance of reality is so great that
they could let any one have the emotion of unreality.
Then there is their feeling about foreigners that
helps a lot.
After all to the french the difference between being
a foreigner and being an inhabitant is not very
serious. There are so many foreigners and all who
are real to them are those that inhabit Paris and France.
In that they are different from other people. Other
people find foreigners more real to them when they
are in their own country but to the french foreigners
are only real to them when they are in France.
18


## p. 19 (#29) ##############################################

Naturally they come to France. What is more
natural for them to do than that.
I remember an old servant invented a nice name
for foreigners, there were Americans they existed
because she was our servant and we were there, and
then there was something she called a creole ecossais,
we never did find out where that came from.
Of course they all came to France a great many to
paint pictures and naturally they could not do that at
home, or write they could not do that at home either,
they could be dentists at home she knew all about
that even before the war, Americans were a practical
people and dentistry was practical. To be sure
certainly, she was the most practical, because when
her little boy was ill, of course she was awfully
unhappy because it was her little boy but then also it
was all to do over again because she did have to have
one child, any french person has to have one child,
and now after two years it was all to do again money
and everything. And still why not of course why
not.
So all this simple clarity in respect to seeing life as
it is, the animal and social life in human beings as it
is, the money value of human and social and animal
life as it is, without brutality or without simplicity,
what is it to-day a french woman said to me
19


## p. 20 (#30) ##############################################

about an American writer, it is false without being
artificial.
It did not take the twentieth century to make them
say that as it has taken the twentieth century to make
other people say that.
Foreigners belong in France because they have
always been here and did what they had to do there
and remained foreigners there. Foreigners should
be foreigners and it is nice that foreigners are for-
eigners and that they inevitably are in Paris and in
France.
They are beginning now at last, cinemas and the
world war have slowly made them realise, what
nationality the foreigners are. In a little hotel
where we stayed some time they spoke of us as
English, no we said no we are Americans, at last
one of them a little annoyed at our persistance said
but it is all the same. Yes I answered like the french
and Italians all the same. Well before the war they
could not have said that nor felt the unpleasantness
of the answer. Then we had a Finnish maid here in
the country, and once she came in all beaming, it is
wonderful, she said, the milk woman knows Finland,
she knows where Finland is, she knows all about
Finland, why, said the Finnish maid, I have known
very educated people who did not know where
20


## p. 21 (#31) ##############################################

Finland was but she knew. Well did she know.
No but she did have the ancient tradition of
french politeness and that was that. They do, of
course.
But really what they do do is to respect art and
letters, if you are a writer you have privileges, if you
are a painter you have privileges and it is pleasant
having those privileges. I always remember coming
in from the country to my garage where I usually
kept my car and the garage was full more than full,
it was the moment of the automobile salon, but said
I what can I do, well said the man in charge I'll see
and then he came back and said in a low voice, there
is a corner and in this corner I have put the car of
Monsieur the academician and next to it I will put
yours the others can stay outside and it is quite true
even in a garage an academician and a woman of
letters takes precedence even of millionaires or
politicians, they do, it is quite incredible but they do,
the police treat artists and writers respectfully too,
well that too is intelligent on the part of France and
unsentimental, because after all the way everything is
remembered is by the writers and painters of the
period, nobody really lives who has not been well ^
written about and in realising that the french show
their usual sense of reality and a belief in a sense of
21


## p. 22 (#32) ##############################################

reality is the twentieth century, people may not have
it but they do believe in it.
They are funny even now they are funny, all the
peasants of the village, well not all but a number of
them were eating their bread and wine, they do quite
nicely now have jam on their bread, nice jam made of
a mixture of apricots and apples, just how they
happen at the same time I do not quite know, yes
perhaps late apricots and early apples, it is very
good.
So we were talking and they said to me, now tell
me, why does the french chamber vote itself two
more years of existence, and we, well of course we
never do have anything to say but why do they, tell
us. Well I said why not, you know it they know it,
and beside if they are there why should not they stay
there. Well said they laughing let's be like Spain.
Let's have a civil war. Well said I what is the use,
after all, after all their shooting each other up they
are going to have their king again any way the king's
son. Then for a change said they, why do not we
have the king's nephew.
That is the way they feel about it, the only thing
that is important is the daily life, and so the gangsters,
so the twentietncentury had really nothing to teach
the french countryman therefore it was the proper
22


## p. 23 (#33) ##############################################

background for the art and literature of the twentieth
century.
The impressionists.
The twentieth century did not invent but it made
a great fuss about series production, series production
really began in the nineteenth century, that is natural
enough, machines are bound to make series produc-
tion.
So although there was more fuss made about
machines and series production in the twentieth
century than in the nineteenth of course it was a
nineteenth century thing.
The impressionists and they were nineteenth
century had as their aspiration and their ideal one
painting a day, really two paintings a day, the morn-
ing painting and the afternoon painting actually it
might have been the early morning and the early
afternoon and the late afternoon. But after all
there is a limit to the human hand after all painting is
hand painting so actually even at their most excited
moment they rarely did more than two more fre-
quently one, and very often not one a day, most
generally not one a day. They had the dream of a
series production but as Monsieur Darantiere said
about printing after all they had not the faults or the
qualities of machines.

So Paris was the natural background for the
twentieth century, America knew it too well, knew
the twentieth century too well to create it, for
America there was a glamour in the twentieth
century that made it not be material for creative
activity. England was consciously refusing the
twentieth century, knowing full well that they had
gloriously created the nineteenth century and perhaps
the twentieth century was going to be too many for
them, so they were quite self consciously denying the
twentieth century but France was not worrying
about it, what is was and what was is, was their
point of view of which they were not very conscious,
they were too occupied with their daily life to worry
about it, beside the last half of the nineteenth century
had really not interested them very much, not since
the end of the romantic movement, they had worked
hard, they always work hard, but the last half of the
nineteenth century had really not interested them
very much. As the peasants always say every year
comes to an end, and they like it when the bad
weather does not keep them from working, they
like to work, it is a pastime for them work is, and so
although the last half of the nineteenth century did
not interest them they did work. And now the
twentieth century had come and it might be more
24


## p. 25 (#35) ##############################################

interesting, if it was to be really interesting of course
they would not work quite so much, being interested
does sometimes stop one from working, work might
then be even somewhat disturbing and distracting.
So the twentieth century had come it began with
1901.

PART III
A n American w ho had read as far as this as far as it
had been written said to me, but you do not mention
the relation of french men to french men, of french
men to french women of french women to french
women of french women to french children of
french men to french children of french children to
french children. No I have not and for a very
simple reason, there is no relation between them, all
the contact between them all is so fixed and inevitable,
so definite and so real that there is no question of
either nature nor choice nor mistake. There can be
no mistake and they cannot be mistaken.
Once in talking to the Baronne Pierlot a very old
french friend she said about something when I said
but Madame Pierlot it is natural, no said Madame
Pierlot it may be nature but it is not natural. She is
eighty-six and her granddaughter eight and it is
difficult at times to know whether they are both
eighty-six or whether they are both eight.
I once wrote and said what is the use of being a
boy if you are to grow up to be a man what is the
26


## p. 27 (#37) ##############################################

use and what is the use. But in France a boy is a man
of his age the age he is and so there is no question of a
boy growing up to be a man and what is the use,
because at every stage of being alive he is completely
a man alive at that time.
This accounts for the very curious relation of every
french man to his mother. Just as he is always alive
all the time and every moment of the time as a
man so he is all his life continually a son dependent
upon his mother. There is no break in that depend-
ence even if a man is sixty years old and that in
France very often does happen, the man is always
dependent upon his mother, and so a frenchman is
always a man because there is nothing inevitably
different between being a boy and a man in a french-
man's life and he is always a son because he is always
dependent upon his mother for his strength his
morality, his hope and his despair, his future and his
past. A frenchman always goes completely to
pieces when his mother dies, he is fortunate if another
woman has come into his life who is a mother to
him.
And now it is once more an August and September
and there is once more a crisis and once more the
farmers the gentle farmers talk about life as it is.
One of the gentlest said to me the other day. We
27


## p. 28 (#38) ##############################################

used to think not we but everybody used to think
that it was kings who were ambitious who were
greedy and who brought misery to the people who
had no way to resist them. But now well democracy
has shown us that what is evil are the grosses tetes,
the big heads, all big heads are greedy for money
and power, they are ambitious that is the reason they
are big heads and so they are at the head of the
government and the result is misery for the people.
They talk about cutting off the heads of the grosses
tetes but now we know that there will be other
grosses tetes and they will be all the same.
He shook his head sadly and went back to his
harvesting.
And so there is no use going on except that the
summers follow one after the other and the fashions
go with the seasons.
If you like fashions you get tired of crises, and the
french like fashions they do not like them they
naturally create them and crises are occasionally a
help to fashions, an occasional crisis is, but not many
of them, many crises in succession interfere with
fashions and so a workman said to me yesterday,
We have had enough of what they make us do we
are tired of crises. And he was right, the season and
the fashions that exist with the seasons are the things
28


## p. 29 (#39) ##############################################

France lives by, the earth has its seasons and the
people who live on that earth have fashions and that
is all.
Fashions are so natural, we were all together at a
house here in the country and somebody said some-
thing of Madame Pierlot's father, what was he. Ah
was the answer, Madame Pierlot is eighty-six and
so all who are younger have naturally forgotten
about her father, but oh some one answered, when
we go up to the attic and find clothes in which to
dress up we always find a piece of ermine and on this
ermine is written the name of Madame Pierlot's
father. What kind of ermine asked some one, and
the ermine was described, ah yes was the answer in
that case he was the judge of the Cour d'appel.
There are fashions that change and fashions that do
not change or fashions that change slowly but there
are always fashions. But fashions as the workman
said cannot live while there are interferences from
the outside, an occasional crisis is alright but not many
of them.
It is because of this that the American married to a
frenchwoman remarked my American sister rises
wonderfully to a crisis but my french wife sees to it
that a crisis does not arise.
There is also another matter, once long ago there
29


## p. 30 (#40) ##############################################

had been a summer rumor of earthquakes and a
servant of a friend of ours living in the avenue Victor
Hugo said we must have an earthquake in Paris
very soon, but why said my friend indignantly, ah
because Madame of course we must suivre le mouve-
ment, follow the fashion.
But the thing to remember is that the french know
the difference between a fashion and something that
is being done that is not a fashion, some people follow
everything but the french have a delicate sense, they
know what is a fashion and what is not a fashion, and
just following the way some nations do is not follow-
ing a fashion, and of course they do not want to feel
any sense of obligation or obedience, obligation and
obedience is the death of fashion and therefore as the
workman said we have had enough of what they
make us do.
And so all this may be only a fire drill, by all this
I mean war and thought of war, the french say if you
can remember three generations of wlr it is enough,
you remember your father, he ate horses' heads in
the war of '70, you remember your husband he was
killed in '17, and your brother who was prisoner in
Switzerland and it cost a good deal of money and
your son and he is now home on leave and he was
called away before his leave was over by a telegram
30


## p. 31 (#41) ##############################################

to go back to his regiment and now, a thing like
this including a daughter who was a school teacher
and had only been married five months and was
called back to evacuate the school children, all this
was enough to make any one's head go right away.
But after all it might only be a fire drill, it might
only be a make believe, any frenchman knows that
you really ought not to know the difference between
danger and no danger.
I was on the boat once going to America. Abbe"
Dimnet was there too and they talked about a fire
drill, they had one, everybody was supposed to put
on safety belts and a boat was lowered but nobody
got into the boat, Abbe Dimnet was indignant, he
said to me they should get into the boat, tell the
captain, said I, I will, said he, he came back, what did
the captain say I asked, he said, said he furious, he
said that you could not get into the boat unless the
ship was stopped it would be too dangerous and to
stop the ship was too costly and took too much time.
The Abbe Dimnet was furious he said yes that is the
way it is they prepare they prepare and they never
know whether they can do what they are prepared
for.
The french are polite, they naturally are, they
never believe in having a surprise inspection, they
31


## p. 32 (#42) ##############################################

always believe in announcing it beforehand, so that
everything can be ready to be inspected and so that
no one will have any unpleasant feelings, and why
not, it is always pleasanter to be polite and as the
french are completely frank, they really cannot he,
if you let any plumber anybody talk long enough
they will always tell the truth. They have so com-
pletely the sense of reality that they cannot really He,
they cannot really eventually not tell the facts as
they are, and therefore they can be as polite as they
want at any time, because politeness does not
interfere with facts, politeness is just another fact.
We once had a chimney-fire and so we decided to
heat by electricity. We had had several chimney-
fires and we had had enough of them and it was in
the winter and we wanted the new system put in
quickly. A frenchman who came to talk about it
said he would but not very quickly, but you must do
it quickly we said but he said that he would do his
best but it would not be as quickly as we thought it
would be done, finally he said alright it would be
done quickly, you see he said reflectively it is atavism,
your being ladies and your asking me to do it quickly,
I cannot help myself I must do what you ask, it is,
said he, with a helpless smile, it is atavism. And it
was and he did it very quickly indeed.
32


## p. 33 (#43) ##############################################

Ah yes the village is sad, the men arc all gone and
one of the women passing said ah yes and now once
again it is evening, well yes once again it is it is
evening.
And so France cannot change it can always have
its fashions but it cannot change. And this brings me
to dogs.
The french dogs which are native are useful dogs
beautiful dogs but dogs that work. They are
shepherd dogs and hunting dogs.
It is funny about dogs. Dogs resemble the nation
which creates them at least we suppose so. Dogs
are certainly like the people that own them and have
them with them all the time. I like the word pastime
as the french use it, it sounds so like the English word
and yet the french make it so completely their own,
who had it first this I do not know, but they cer-
tainly use it perhaps best. Dogs which are not useful
dogs are a pastime, as one woman once said to me,
one has a great deal of pleasure out of dogs because
one can spoil them as one cannot spoil one's children.
If the children are spoiled, one's future is spoilt
but dogs one can spoil without any thought of the
future and that is a great pleasure.
So the french dogs which are useful are native, the
various shepherd dogs and the various hunting dogs,
f 33


## p. 34 (#44) ##############################################

they are beautiful and they are useful, they are com-
panions but they are not pets, they cannot be spoiled
with pleasure to the spoiler as dogs that are pets can
be spoiled, beside the useful animal is never a thing
which is in or out of fashion, I always like the story
of the shepherd near Aix-en-Provence, he was taking
his dog to kill him he used to kill them by hanging,
when they are eight years old they no longer inter-
ested themselves in sheep, and as bread is dear you
cannot keep a dog who is not interested in his trade.
They know that at eight years of age he will stop
being interested in tending sheep and so with tears
streaming from his eyes off he goes to hang him.
There is another nice story of a dog in Aix-en-
Provence, there was a girl in a cafe who was very
fond of a dog who used to come there regularly
with a man and she regularly gave him a lump of
sugar, one day the man came in without the dog
and said the dog was dead. The girl had the lump of
sugar in her hand and when she heard the dog was
dead tears came to her eyes and she ate the lump of
sugar.
The french have to have as pet dogs foreign ones
which they change and fashion in their own way,
and the mode in these dogs changes, they mostly
always come back again, as long as I have known
34


## p. 35 (#45) ##############################################

France first it was poodles then it was Belgian griffons,
fox-terriers, always called a fox, when I first heard it
called a fox I thought it was a fox until I saw it, then
Alsatian wolf hounds and Pekinese and then wire-
haired terriers and now poodles, they having invented
a new way to shave the poodle and a new color to
make the poodles, so they are in again and this time
at the same time the fox terriers have come back.
Now all these dogs being of no use can be made
fashionable, because fashion must never be useful,
must very often be exotic, and must always be made
to be french. That is what fashion is and it must
change.
And this brings me back once more to the question
of the resemblance of a dog to its country people.
It is a puzzle why are german dogs all rather timid
gentle friendly and obedient, they are that, the charac-
teristic german dogs, it kind of cheers one up that
some time they the people will be that because people
and dogs must be alike in a country in which they
are born and bred and have descended. There are
the poodles, the dachshunds, even the dog which is
a kind of a bull, the Bismark dog is gentle and the
german black police-dog is a much gentler animal
than the Alsatian wolfhound, it is a funny thing this,
being fond of poodles, and always having them I
35


## p. 36 (#46) ##############################################

bother about all this. I thought poodles were
french but the french breed always has to be
refreshed by the german one, and the german pincher
is so much more gentle than our Chichuachua little
dog which it resembles, and so everything would be
a puzzle if it were not certain that logic is right, and is
stronger than the will of man. We will see.
The characteristic art product of a country is the
pulse of the country, France did produce better hats
and fashions than ever these last two years and is
therefore very alive and Germany's music and
musicians have been dead and gone these last two
years and so Germany is dead well we will see, it is
so, of course as all these things are necessarily true.
The fancy and imagination of every country is so
different. I have just written a child's book called
The World Is Round and an English friend who
lives in France here being married to a Frenchman,
Betty Leyris, has a three months old baby, and I said
I would give her a copy for little Johnny when he
could read. And said Betty I hope by the time he is
old enough to read it that the world will still be
round.
Now that is purely an English imagination that
and so each country is important at different times
because the world in general needs a different
36


## p. 37 (#47) ##############################################

imagination at different times and so there is the
Paris France from 1900 to 1030. where everybody
■had to be to be free.
The war is going on this war and we were all
waiting and the telephone rang, well and it was the
Mere Mollard announcing that her quenelles had
turned on her, she had ice and she had put them on
ice and she had taken them out to look at them and
they had turned sour. Well anyway even if there is
no food and there is a war and she is not a good cook
cooking is important.
The Doctor Chaboux managed well he did not try
but he did kill a hare with his automobile on the
road and we were invited to eat it, with jugged hare
you always have to eat boiled potatoes and really
boiled potatoes and hare were very good. They
say in the country here that potatoes are the healthiest
of all foods, to be sure they do eat a great deal of
bread as well and wine but after all, they say, you
do give potatoes to sick people you do not give
them bread, bread is for the strong, potatoes are for
the healthy and the ill, but what really is important
is that in this very country where the twentieth
century was to be found and celebrated in the arts
they still call them the Mere Mollard, or the Pere
Mollard or the Fils Mollard and they call a painter
37


## p. 38 (#48) ##############################################

who is old cher maitre. They will do that. I cannot
write too much upon how necessary it is to be com-
pletely conservative^that is particularly traditional;
in order to be free. And so France is and was.
Sometimes it is important and sometimes it is not,
but from 1900 to 1939, it certainly was.
War is more like a novel than it is like real life
and that is its eternal fascination. It is a thing based
on reality but invented, it is a dream made real, all
the things that make a novel but not really life.
And that makes one think a great deal about music,
war naturally does make music but certainly this
war with everybody really everybody listening to
the radio, there is nothing but music. There used
to be a song that was sung called Music In The Air,
but when that song was written nobody really
thought that there would be all this music in the air.
After all really civilised countries do not con-
tinuously make music, and that is the reason that
France and England are the most civilised countries.
They are not everlastingly making music.
And therefore France was so important 4n—ihe_
periojLbetw^en^iQOjniLLgjp, it was a periodwhen
merereallyjHm-^serious efFoj^jnade^yJiujnanity-to-
be civilised, the world was round and there really
were not left any unknown on it and so everybody
38


## p. 39 (#49) ##############################################

decided to be civilised. England had the disadvantage
of believing in progress, and progress has really
nothing to do with civilisation, but France could be
civilised without having progress on her mind, she
could believe in civilisation in and for itself, and so
she was the natural background for this period.
The relation of men to women and men to men
and women to women in a state of being civilised
has to be very much considered. Frenchmen love
older women, that is women who have already done
more living, and that has something to do with
civilisation, they do not believe in comradeship
really not with any one, they said in their revolution
Egalite Fraternite Liberie, but these qualities should
be left to war and politics, they are not human.
Humanly speaking, Frenchwomen nor Frenchmen
do not really interest themselves in intimacy, intimacy
is something essentially uncivilised, civilisation makes
young men interested in a woman of thirty and an
interest in a spirit of equality with a very young
woman is more or less a sign of senility, and senility
is of course not civilised.
A soldier at the front from this village wrote a
letter, he was seeing the evacuation of the German
villages and he writes, it is sad to see farms evacuated,
to see animals leaving the places they are used to, it
39


## p. 40 (#50) ##############################################

is very sad, you my father and I, we understand this
thing but my mother she will not understand.
Well that is one way of feeling and we had made
a sudden visit to Paris and were back here in the hills
far away, and one of the farmers, he is a tall bearded
farmer who drinks a great deal of wine, but is for all
that a most excellent farmer, he asked me what the
people in Paris were doing. They were all carrying
gas masks, I answered, ah yes he said, pour remplacer
les muguets to replace lilies of the valley as a decora-
tion.
A farmer naturally says such things in France but
he is not intimate, he is not intimate with man, woman
or child or animal, he is not intimate, it is not civilised
to be intimate and the French need to be civilised and
in order to do so he must have tradition and freedom
and with tradition and freedom one cannot be inti-
mate with any one.
This too was very necessary in this twentieth
century, when the present was so completely domi-
nating.
The only thing any Frenchman minds in war is
sleeping on straw, nobody sleeps on straw, no
French vagabond no French soldier, they must have
a roof over them and something that is built like a
bed. The only thing any French soldier ever com-
40


## p. 41 (#51) ##############################################

plains about is when that awful thing happens to
him, he has to sleep on straw. Once more, it is not
the discomfort, it is the destruction of civilisation
that he resents, and he is right.
Otherwise war is full of fashion and Frenchmen
although they want peace, realise the quality of
fashion profoundly inherent in war.
A woman in the village, that was before this war
began said to me one day, they used to laugh gayly
before the war she meant 1914 war and since then
they have not laughed, they seem to enjoy themselves
but they do not laugh, she wondered was it that they
had forgotten or that you did not laugh, perhaps she
said if there is a whole generation that never heard of
war they will laugh. Perhaps not, she said, she
realised that it might never again happen that any one
would really laugh.
Fashion is in everything except in the making of
war, but war makes fashions.
Back again to 1900 when there were fashions but
no war.
Well not exactly because there was a war, there is
always mostly always a war somewhere but not a
general European war.
It is hard to believe that there is always going to
be a general European war and yet well yet it does
G 41


## p. 42 (#52) ##############################################

make something that there always is going to be a
general European war, it makes logic.
I was in the country here in France last September
the September when there was not a war. I live in
the French country in the summer in a little village
where there are perhaps twenty families and I know
them all and their oxen and cows and dogs, I know
them all and they know me and my car and my
dogs. Well it was that September when there was
no war and I felt as we all did and I went out on the
road walking with my dogs, and I had just heard
that one of my neighbours Monsieur Lambert had
been mobilised as they were all mobilised because
there might be going to be a war. He is a tall thin
man, a gentle soul, a good farmer and a good soldier,
forty-five years old. I met him with his wife and
oxen. And I said you are leaving to go, Monsieur
Lambert. Yes, he said, and my wife is crying. Is
there going to be a war, I said. No, he said, my
wife is crying but there is not going to be a war.
Why not, I said. Because, said he, it is not logical.
You see I am forty-five years old, I fought the whole
of the last war, my son is seventeen years old, he and
I would fight this war. It is not logical mademoiselle
that I at forty-five who fought the war, with a son of
seventeen, should believe in a general European war.
42


## p. 43 (#53) ##############################################

It is not logical. Now said he, if I were sixty and
my grandson was seventeen, we might both believe
in a general European war and there might be a war,
but I at forty-five and my son at seventeen, no
Mademoiselle. It is not logical. But, I said, that is
alright for you, the French are a logical people, but
the Germans and the Italians. Mademoiselle, he said,
they talk differently but they believe the same.
Well he went away and then in almost ten days he
came back and there he was on the road with his
wife and his oxen, and I walking with my dogs met
him. I said, Monsieur Lambert you were right there
was no war. No he said no Mademoiselle it is not
logical.
To-day and now there is a war I met them and I
said I was noticing how tall the boy was, he is
bigger than his father. Alas yes said the mother, he
is eighteen and will the war last and take him. She
was not crying, she was thinking. Monsieur Lambert
is right therefore logic is logic and perhaps after all
it will not be a general European war, and not a real
war.
So there are the two sides to a Frenchman, logic
and fashion and that is the reaon why French people
are exciting and peaceful.
Logic and fashion.
43


## p. 44 (#54) ##############################################

Then they also say it is war and we must help each
other, in ptance-thcy-BMist not hflg^each other in
peace-time, the joy of peace is that everybody^can
take care of themselves jhat is--of—their unit as a
family;
That is another interesting thing about French
people, that they know that.
It is difficult to go back to 1901 now that it is 1939
and war-time.
But at that time 1901 one day at dinner everybody
was talking about war, it was war-time then only
it was a Russian Japanese war. The servant who was
waiting at table suddenly heard some one say that the
enemy had just won a battle,—she was carrying a
large platter and she dropped it and cried out oh is
it the Germans who have come. Naturally war only
meant to her Germans.
Of course it is awful to be always under the threat
of war and yet does it do something about logic and
fashion that is interesting.
Is it possible that America does not know that the
world is round because there is no threat of war. To
be sure they have had a good many wars but they
have had no threat of war. Wars and threat of
wars are different things and threat of war does
perhaps help to logic and fashion.
44


## p. 45 (#55) ##############################################

Do Americans perhaps think the world is flat
because of their continent just as Europe knows it is
round because Columbus sailed from Europe to
prove it and even if he did hit up against a flat
continent he was sure of it. Russia and America
do have a tendency to think the world is not round
but it is, but logic and fashion know that it is round
and they also know that it does go around and
around.
So once more back to the beginning of the twen-
tieth century of France and Paris and everybody in
it and of it.
But still now it is 1939 and war-time, well it was
just beginning and everything was agitating and one
day we were with our friends the Daniel-Rops
they are our neighbors in the country and he was
expecting a call to go to Paris and the telephone
rang. He went quickly to answer it, he was away
some time and we were all anxious. He came back.
We said what is it. He said the quenelles the Mere
Mollard was making for us have gone soft.
Quenelles, well quenelles are the special dish of this
country made of flour and eggs and shredded fish or
chicken and pounded by the hour and then rolled and
then hardened in the cold air and then cooked in a
sauce and they are good.
45


## p. 46 (#56) ##############################################

We all laughed we regretted the quenelles but it
was French of her with a son at the front to be
worried about her quenelles.
Cooking like everything else in France is logic and
fashion.
The French are right when they claim that
French cooking is an art and is part of their culture
because it is based on latin Roman cooking and has
been influenced by Italy and Spain. The crusades
only brought them new material, it did not introduce
into France the manner of cooking and very little
was changed.
French cooking is traditional, they give up the past
with difficulty in fact they never do give it up and
when they have had reforms so called in the seven-
teenth century and in the nineteenth century, they
only accepted it when it became really a fashion in
Paris, but when they took something from the
outside like the Polish baba brought by Stanislas
Leczinski, the father-in-law of Louis XV or the
Austrian croissant brought by Marie Antoinette,
they took it over completely so completely that it
became French so completely French that no other
nation questions it. By the way the Austrian crois-
sant was hurriedly made at the siege of Vienna in
1683 by the Polish soldiers of Sobieski to replace the
46


## p. 47 (#57) ##############################################

bread that was missing and they called it the crescent
the emblem of the Turks whom they were fighting.
Catherine de Medici in the sixteenth century
brought cooks with her and made desserts fashionable,
complicated Italian desserts, before that there had
been nothing sweet in France except fruits. It was
in 1541 that at a ball she introduced these desserts into
Paris.
During the time of Henry the Fourth they went
back to simple foods as he called himself the king of
Gonesse where the best bread in France was made.
The French did though have ideas that one is apt
to think of as American and Oriental, roasted ducks
with oranges, and stuffed turkeys with raspberries,
they ate the turkeys young, and a salad with nuts and
apples in the time of Louis XIV.
Cook books were best sellers in France through the
seventeenth century and in the introduction to the
Dons de Comus, 1739, it was said that " the modern
kitchen is a kind of chemistry," so it is evident that
cooking in France always was logic and fashion and
tradition, which is French.
The ice-creams that came from Italy were water-
ices that were soft but they the French witli that basis
made a solid ice-cream which afterwards they
themselves called Neapolitan, which is their way.

## p. 48 (#58) ##############################################

The logic of the French cooking is that they used all
their material in as complicated ways as they knew
and this was refined by foreign influences which
became the fashion until the death of Louis the
fourteenth and under the Regency they had a full
burst of inspired French completely French cooks
and cooking, the regent himself had a set of silver
casseroles and he did his cooking with his courtiers
and it was said that the silver casseroles were not
more valuable than the things he put in them.
More than half of the dishes of the present great
cooking of France were created by the court, the
men and the women, the great mistresses of that
period were either very religious or very great cooks
and sometimes both, the great men around the court
were all interested in cooking.
The dishes created by them were named after
them, to be sure frequently it was their cooks who
really created them but it was the courtier who got
the credit and made them the fashion.
Louis XV made his own coffee, he never allowed
any one else to make his coffee.
The thing that was particular about all the dishes
of that period was the sauces, these dishes practi-
cally all were famous because of their sauces, the
cooking of the dish was important but the sauce
48


## p. 49 (#59) ##############################################

was its creation. The material for the forcemeat
of these dishes was developed enormously at this
period.
Another thing they discovered then was the use
of yolks of eggs for thickening their sauces instead
of bread crumbs, and this as is easily seen revolu-
tionised cooking and sauces. This was a purely
French invention.
The Revolution of course stopped cooking and
under Napoleon who did not know what he was
eating, he rarely expressed a preference but he asked
his cook to give him some flat sausages, his cook
disgusted prepared an elaborate dish of finely chopped
ingredients, Napoleon ate it without knowing they
were not sausages.
But at that moment to save French cooking,
Antonin Careme began cooking and he is the creator
of present French cooking, but of course much
simplified now because then neither material nor
work was of any importance.
He made a juice an essence to use in sauces of beef
veal and five turkeys and that only should produce a
quart of juice.
Traditional again, he went back to the elaborate
set dishes really almost of mediaeval France and the
Renaissance, but their flavor was elaborated and
H 49


## p. 50 (#60) ##############################################

refined by all the material for cooking that had come
into the country since.
Under Louis-Napoleon the writers and poets
became the appreciators and critics of cooking as
well as the financiers and the court, so Dumas wrote a
cook-book, and this went on until the siege of Paris
by the Germans and there in the cellars they
cooked as elaborately as they knew how to disguise
the queer things they had to eat.
When the restaurants became fashionable in the
middle of the seventeenth century anybody who had
money enough went and in that way learned how to
eat, the restaurants had great cooks and really it was
through the restaurants that good cooking and fashion
in cooking was always diffused throughout France.
The restaurants continued the tradition of popu-
larising complicated and fine cooking that could
hardly be done in a simple kitchen and all this until
the beginning of the republic after the siege of Paris
when everybody more or less at some time even the
smallest of the middle classes would be conscious of
the great dishes of the French cooking even if not
greatly cooked. But in many places they still did
cook greatly as well as make the great dishes and
that brings me to the Paris I first knew when the
Cafe Anglais still existed.
50


## p. 51 (#61) ##############################################

At the Cafe Anglais their pride in French cooking
expressed itself in the perfection of simple dishes, a
saddle of mutton so perfectly and so delicately roasted
that in itself it became peaceful and exciting, a roast
chicken at Voisin's of the same perfection, sauces
instead of being elaborate in these places became
simple and perfect, this was in the beginning of the
twentieth century.
At the same time as there existed these restaurants
who had turned perfect elaboration into perfect
simplicity there were the restaurants for the middle
classes whose simplicity was beginning to be rather
heavy, and the cooking for the lower classes, where
simplicity was beginning to be a little too plain and
everybody naturally did still talk about cooking.
The hush that always falls when in a French dining-
room or in a French restaurant a new dish is presented
no matter how poor how rich how simple or how
complicated the dish is did still always come but
Paris did a little disappoint the provincials when they
came to Paris.
I remember being told by a French woman that
she could remember when she was a child and they
lived in the provinces, the wonder and the awe when
Parisians came and brought with them some food
from Paris. Now she said the Parisians buy every-
51


## p. 52 (#62) ##############################################

thing they can in the shape of cake or a dish to take
with them to Paris. The provinces were having a
higher standard of cooking than the capital.
So cooking was decidedly falling off in that period
just before the war, they still talked about it, the
hush before the new dish was still there, the provinces
still had good food, but Paris food was not delicate
and perfect any more. And then there was the war.
After the war there was the Americanisation of
France, automobiles which kept them from staying
at home, cocktails, the worry of spending money
instead of saving it, because spending money is
always a worry to French people, if they can save life
is interesting, if they spend life is dull, and then the
introduction of electric stoves and the necessity of not
cooking too long, in short French cooking went out
and there were very few houses practically none in
Paris where cooking was considered an art.
And then slowly it began again. People would
begin to talk about some little town far away where
a woman cooked, really cooked and everybody
would go there no matter how far away it was, the
Club of the Hundred formed itself to encourage
cooking, the Club of the Four Hundred went beyond
the Club of the Hundred.
There was Madame Bourgeois in a little lost town
$2


## p. 53 (#63) ##############################################

in the centre of France. She and her husband who
had been servants in one of the homes in France that
still cared for cooking had inherited a little cafe in
this little town that was not on the road to anywhere
not even on a railroad. And she began to cook,
nobody came except a few fishermen and the local
tradesmen and every day she cooked her best dinner
for them and then one day after two years of this, a
man from Lyon came by accident, a lawyer, and he
was pleased with his dinner and he asked her if she
could undertake to cook for a dozen of them who
were going to celebrate the legion of honor of one
of them and she said yes, and from then on the place
was famous and she always tired as she was cooked
with the same perfection.
The cooking was simple the twentieth century
seemed to want it simple but it was less delicate and
a bit richer than the last of the great Paris restaurants.
And so it was the time for the provinces to give the
fashion to Paris.
There was no longer a Paris cuisine, there was
regional cooking and Paris had to learn from the pro-
vinces instead of the provinces learning from Paris.
Last September 1938 when the war did not come
one of our friends in the country here, a great cook
and a great gourmet, was mobilised a captain of
53


## p. 54 (#64) ##############################################

reserve and he had a whole garrison to organise.
And I have a charming photograph of him, snapped
by a stray visitor, a Polish journalist, he is looking
violently at a soldier and the conversation was this.
Will you, said Captain d'Aiguy, make us a good
risotto, I cannot, my captain, said the soldier who
was a cook in one of the big restaurants in Paris,
because I have not the foundation of a sauce. Foun-
dation for a sauce, said the captain pale with fury,
you have material to cook with, everything you
want and you cannot make your sauce you have to
have a foundation, what do you mean by a founda-
tion. If you please, said the trembling cook, in
Paris we always have a foundation for a sauce and
we put that in and then mix the sauce. Yes said
Captain d'Aiguy and it tastes like it. Let me teach
you French cooking. You have the material and you
make your sauce.
Well now the war has commenced again 1939 and
the soldiers are all talking about their food, and
perhaps when they come back there will be a new
outburst of French cooking, it was preparing, the
foreign influences after the 1914 war have worn
themselves off and now everybody is staying at home
again and so naturally they will think about cooking.
When you first really get to know the French one
54


## p. 55 (#65) ##############################################

of the first things that puzzles you is the insistence
upon their latinity. They do not consider Italians
or Spaniards latin, but they the french are latin, they
insist upon being Gauls but all the same they are
latin. Finally I realised that what they meant was
that the spirit of latinity was kept purer by them the
Gallo-Romans than it was in Italy which lost its
latinity when they were overcome by barbarians and
never recreated it, they might take on the forms and
symbols of Rome but essentially the latin culture
went out of Italy and it never existed in Spain so its
true home has been France. And there is a good
deal of truth in it all. At first I did not know what
they were talking about but gradually I did begin to
feel what they meant by their latinity.
They meant of course logic, the only people who
were interested in logic were the Romans, logic
because logical people are never brutal, they are never
sentimental, they are never careless, they are never
intimate, in short they are peaceful and exciting,
that is to say they are French. The French under-
stand war because they are logical, they do not care
to go to war because they are logical, and to be
logical is to be latin. That is what I was gradually
understanding. It took me a long time to really
understand it.
55


## p. 56 (#66) ##############################################

To be latin was to be civilized to be logical and to
be fashionable and the French were and they knew it.
They explained it in so many ways that it took a long
time to realise it, and perhaps it was in their descrip-
tion of their education that I understood it best.
The relation of the French to Napoleon is perhaps
the most curious thing in them, because Napoleon
was only latin insofar as he was a soldier, he was not
civilized he was not logical and he was not fashion-
able. It is really the only time in their history that
they have not been completely French, but that was
natural enough, the revolution had sentimentalised
them and strangely enough it was not until the
romantic movement came that they once more
became French. Napoleon because he was not
French had a glamour for them and beside they then
had for the only time in their history an idea of
propaganda of trying to make other people think
as they were tninking. Propaganda is not French,
it is not civilized to want other people to believe
what you believe because the essence of being civilised
is to possess yourself as you are, and if you possess
yourself as you are you of course cannot possess any
one else, it is not your business. It is because of this
element of civilization that Paris has always been the
home of all foreign artists, they are friendly, the
56


## p. 57 (#67) ##############################################

French, they surround you with a civilised atmosphere
and they leave you inside of you completely to
yourself. And their logic too makes it impossible to
be propagandists. If there is one thing in the world
that is not logical it is propaganda, and also it is the
one thing in the world that has nothing to do with
fashion. The difference between propaganda and
fashion is very interesting.
I like to listen to French people tell about their
education. Everybody in France naturally tells
about their education, because after all education
inevitably has to do with civilisation. They tell you,
I remember Rene Crevel telling about his education,
what effect the lycee has upon them, it does not make
them a type in character or in manner as similar
schools do with the Northern peoples but it has to
do simply with the mind. Francois d'Aiguy says
lycees because they were founded by Napoleon
stamp your mind, the college or the bolte the catholic
schools because they form your character do not
form your mind. So which will you have. The
discussion of this matter is unending and it always
comes back to the question of latinity. At the same
time you have the pride in being of peasant stock and
the pride in being always in their youth ripe for
revolution. I remember Lolo whom we loved very
I 57


## p. 58 (#68) ##############################################

much who always said I am a peasant, well I suppose
he might have been but was he. He was a peasant,
so he said, he was young and so he was a revolu-
tionary, so he said, and whatever he admired he
called with a fine rolling voice, royale. He explained
a great deal about revolutions.
He said all French men had to be revolutionary,
that is they had to be in revolt, no matter what it was
they had they had to be in revolt, not for publicity
but for civilization. How could you be civilised
if you had not passed through a period of revolt,
and then you had to return to your pre-revolt stage
■-and there you were you were civilised. All French-
men know that you have to become civilised between
eighteen and twenty-three and that civilization
comes upon you by contact with an older woman, by
revolution, by army discipline, by any escape or by
any subjection, and then you are civilised and life
goes on normally in a latin way, life is then peaceful
and exciting, life is then civilised, logical and fashion-
j able in short life is life.
That is one of the troubles Frenchmen of the post-
war generation had in what was called the epoch.
It was a Frenchman who said it to me, he said war
is not civilising and the men who were eighteen to
twenty-three in the war missed their time for
58


## p. 59 (#69) ##############################################

becoming civilised. War can not civilise, it takes
private life to civilize, and of course publicity has the
same effect as war it prevents the process of civiliza-
tion.
That was really the trouble with the sur-realist
crowd, they missed their moment of becoming
civilised, they used their revolt, not as a private but as
a public thing, they wanted publicity not civilisation,
and so really they never succeeded in being peaceful
and exciting, they did not succeed in the real sense in
being fashionable and certainly not in being logical.
This does bring me back to Paris from 1900 to
1939.
Some one was telling me the other day who knew
Debussy very well, that Debussy prided himself on
being a peasant of course he was not but that is the
way he felt about it and on being a French musician.
He said that German music stopped with the empire
and so French music which was the music of civiliza-
tion, logic and fashion could naturally begin. He
was not supposed to have said quite that but that is
what he meant.
He also said that the empire was manifestly not
healthy for Germany because music was not doing
anything, it tailed off with Strauss. He was also said
to have said that Eric Satie had an extraordinary
59


## p. 60 (#70) ##############################################

endowment but he could not work. He being a
peasant believed in work. Any peasant does.
French life has elements of strangeness in it. In
France a young girl is treated as a young girl, she is
a young girl until she is a married woman when she
is not any longer a young girl, but and, this is
extraordinary, a young girl of twenty-one or
twenty-two becomes a school-teacher, and in France
in the country a school-teacher has to live alone in
the school-house. A young girl will go into a
mountain village or a village in the plains, or a
village anywhere and the school-house is never in
the village but well outside of it quite isolated with
its living quarters for the school-teacher, and there
she lives alone, she may be very young but there she
is living alone in an empty school-house, doing her
own work, and feeding herself and living alone.
When I really realised this I was surprised and I
said does not that contradict the feeling about a
young girl and her protection, no they said, it is
understood, and if it is understood to be so nothing
happens that should not happen and very evidently
nothing does. Even loneliness does not really seem
to happen even though the school-house may be in
a village in the mountains snowed in for long
months.
60


## p. 61 (#71) ##############################################

It surprised us but it did not surprise the French.
And back again to the twentieth century.
The characteristic thing of the twentieth century
was the idea of production in a series, that one thing
should be like every other thing, and that it should
all be made alike and quantities of them. As I said
the impressionists had the idea that a painting should
be painted every day indeed preferably two a day,
morning and afternoon. That was the nineteenth
century, and then the twentieth century believed
that painting should be completely subjective and
not objective, that thoughts should be painted and
not things seen. And so naturally even more than
even one painting a day or two or even four could be
painted because complete tlroughts come all the time
and each time any of them thought they thought a
thought and this thought being painted was com-
plete.
The twentieth century was not interested in
impressions, it was not interested in emotions it was
interested in conceptions and so there was the
twentieth century painting.
These conceptions all have to do with the world
being round and everybody knowing all about it
and there being illimitable space and everybody
knowing all about it and if anybody knows all
61


## p. 62 (#72) ##############################################

about the world being round and all about illimitable
space the first thing they do is to paint their concep-
tions of these things and that the twentieth century
painting did.
But, and this is very important the French back-
ground never did disassociate itself from the earth,
the world is all round and everybody knows all
about it, but even if they do, there it still is the
ground, it is still there.
They the french were the only ones who really
knew it was still there, even though it was in France
that twentieth century art and literature is made.
I was very pleased one day when the wife of the
local doctor, he and she are fond of digging a bit
and here when you dig a bit, beside making things
grow, there is Roman, and Gallo-Roman, and even
earlier things to be found. Well one day we were
out in the car and she said one day when the work-
men were first cutting this road through there on
that ledge were the ancestors, lots of their bones. It
is always there life and death death and life and the
earth and it is never anything to be remembered or
even talked about, and that is the reason the French
do not make much lyrical poetry. They do not get
away from the earth enough to look at it, they paint
it, but they do not poetise it.
62


## p. 63 (#73) ##############################################

As always art is the pulse of a nation. I was just
thinking of a good title for an art book. From
Bismark to Hitler, any one can see that since 1870
and to 1939 Germany has had no art. When a
country is in such a state that people who like to buy
things can find nothing to buy there is something
wrong.
Once when I was crossing the American continent,
years and years ago and we were caught in the
prairies without an engine to take us anywhere, the
news-agent who sold things on the train came and
offered us ten bananas for ten cents and then added,
when a news-agent offers you ten bananas for ten
cents you know there is something wrong.
That is the state of a nation when there is no art
that is natural to that nation, you know there is
something wrong. Ever since Germany has been
an empire there has been nothing anybody wanted to
buy and after having bought wanted to leave to a
museum, neither music nor pottery nor poetry, and
so there is something wrong. The state of being an
empire was not a healthy state.
There is a very interesting thing in this connection.
France naturally was never interested in English
painting and only very recently there was a collection
shown of Blake and Turner. The French were
63


## p. 64 (#74) ##############################################

astonished, they felt that somehow here was some-
thing that the later twentieth century needed. The
painting of the young Englishman Francis Rose
affected a good many of us the same way, after all
if you know that the world is round and that space
is unlimited well why talk about it any more. Facts
are facts. It is a fact and so let us know it but not
remember it. All great facts should_be known but
not remembered like the earth to the French, and
so for the first time for a long time the phenomena of
nature, thunder and storms and mountains and birds
were things to live among. The English who
naturally do live in among these things but in the
confusion of refusing the twentieth century had lost
their vitality of creating them they the English were
once more finding the new thing in their old thing,
in the thing that was natural to them and so in this
war 1939 they are coming into their own, ideas are
not important but light and loveliness is important.
The French with their feeling for fashion know
that the English have found themselves again and
they say Cette fois nous avons un allie\les Anglais.
64


## p. 65 (#75) ##############################################

PART IV
I like words of one syllable and it works out
very well in the French order for general mobilisa-
tion. The printed thing gives all the detail and then
it says the army de terre, de mer et de l'air. That
is very impressive when you read it in every village.
It could be a puzzle why the intellectuals in every^
country are always wanting a form of government
which would inevitably treat them badly, purge
them so to speak before anybody else is purged. It
has always happened from the French revolution to
to-day. It would be a puzzle this if it were not that
it is true that the world is round and that space is
illimitable unlimited. I suppose it is that that makes
the intellectual so anxious for a regimenting govern-
ment which they could so ill endure.
And so war comes and it has its advantages, it does
make a concentration of isolation, there are so many
more people, animals and fowls and children in war-
time than in peace-time, but it does all make for a
concentration of isolation and this is interesting.
And old French friend, Madame Pierlot once said
K 65


## p. 66 (#76) ##############################################

to me she is now eighty-eight and she said that she is
so much more flattered now than when she was a
fascinating young woman. Fitzgerald once said to
me it is easy to charm the old. But that is not the
whole story it is easy for the old to charm.
Perhaps this war will make ages reasonable again,
the last war completely destroyed ages, and I suppose
life inevitably is calmer if there are ages.
Which makes this war real again. Uniforms say
the French make every one younger and then when
you take the uniform off it makes everybody just that
much older. In the last war uniforms were worn so
long that that consciousness was lost but now more
uniforms come off and on, mobilisation and demobili-
sation takes place more frequently, as Bernard Fay
just wrote I have come back to Paris and so many of
my friends have been demobilised and it makes them
feel rather sheepish.
And so ages have come into existence again.
But then there was the mistake about Kiki Vincent.
Madame Chaboux told it to me. It is she who
cooked jugged hare better than anybody else in the
region, and it was she who told how she and her
husband and two friends went to an inn for dinner
where they made a specialty of jugged hare and
as the dish was presented to them and the hush
66


## p. 67 (#77) ##############################################

fell upon them the hush with which French people
always receive a dish, the friend half crying said but
they have not left us any morceaux ronds, there was
nothing there but shoulders and legs and heads,
there were no round pieces, the round pieces that so
deliciously are made by the centre of the animal.
So now we never see a jugged hare without thinking
of the morceaux ronds whose non-appearance is a
poignant grief.
We met Madame Chaboux coming out of the
garrison barracks, what said we are you doing there,
ah she said I went to see the captain about Kiki, Kiki
Vincent.
So when we wanted to know she told us.
The woman at the market who sells butter and
cheese always used, before the 1939 war, always
used to come in a wagon drawn by a white horse.
And now there was war, horses had been requisitioned
and she came in an old automobile. Madame
Chaboux bought her butter and cheese and asked if
all the family were well, and the butter-woman began
to drop tears on the cheese. All she said except
Kiki. But they have not taken Kiki said Madame
Chaboux, oh but they have was the answer, he was
twenty years old the good horse Kiki but he did not
look his age, he always appeared youthful and so
67


## p. 68 (#78) ##############################################

when they were taking horses, we had no proof he
was twenty but he was twenty and he used to put his
head out of the stable just opposite to my kitchen and
we used to talk together and my husband says it is
nothing but he is suffering and the children when
we go out they say where is Kiki Vincent, will he
come back and of course although he looked so
young he was twenty and of course he will not come
back. Madame Chaboux said that if she had his
number she would see if he could be found perhaps
he had not gone far, so she went to see the captain
with the number, 73726 and underneath written
Kiki on a piece of paper, and there were two horses
there that had not gone yet but they had a different
number and she had their numbers too on a piece of
paper, 72943 and 74056 but they were not Kiki.
The captain said if he had only known in time he
could have saved Kiki but now Kiki was gone.
I have the two pieces of paper with the numbers but
Kiki is gone, and army life is hard on horses so Kiki
Vincent is gone.
The French like to call beasts up-to-date names,
names of people do not change much but they like
to follow the fashion in animal's names.
It always pleases me that French boys are often
called Jean-Marie, you can use a female name to go
68


## p. 69 (#79) ##############################################

with a man's name, it hallows the male name to add
the female name to it, and that is civilised and logical
and might be fashionable, it has always existed.
But the animals' names are a different matter,
there are all the regular names and then there are
other ones. I remember the pleasure in hearing a
farmer call one of his oxen Landru, is it really his
name I asked oh yes, he said, but not because he is a
murderer, oh no, he said, just to like it. Of course
most female dogs are called Diane, that is inevitable,
but all the terriers have English names, they are called
Jimmie and Tom and one is known as Nickey Boy de
Belley.
Our dog's name is Basket and the French like that,
it sounds well in French and goes very well with
Monsieur, the children all call him Monsieur Basket
more or less to rhyme with casquette.
That was the first Basket.
We did love the first Basket and he was shaved like
a real poodle and he did fait le beau and he could say
how do you do and he was ten years old and last
autumn just after our return to Paris he died. We
did cry and cry and finally every one said get another
dog and get it right away.
Henry Daniel-Rops said get another as like Basket
as possible call him by the same name and gradually
69


## p. 70 (#80) ##############################################

there will be confusion and you will not know which
Basket it is. They had done that twice with their
little white TenerifFe which they call Claudine.
And then I saw Picasso, and he said no, never get
the same kind of a dog again never, he said I tried it
once and it was awful, the new one reminded me of
the old one and the more he looked like him the
worse it was. Why said he, supposing I were to die,
you would go out on the street and sooner or later
you would meet a Pablo, but it would not be I and
it would be the same. No never get the same kind
of a dog, get an Afghan hound, he has one, and Jean
Hugo had said I could have one, but they are so sad,
I said, that's all right for a Spaniard, but I don't like
dogs to be sad, well he said get what you like but
not the same, and as I went out he repeated not the
same no not the same.
So we tried to have the same and not to have the
same and there was a very large white poodle offered
to us who looked like a young calf with black spots
and other very unpleasant puppies with little pink
eyes and then at last we found another Basket, and we
got him and we called him Basket and he is very gay and
I cannot say that the confusion between the old and
the new has yet taken place but certainly le roi^est
niQrt^iyeJerpi, is a normal attitude of mind.
70


## p. 71 (#81) ##############################################

I was a little worried what Picasso would say when
he saw the new Basket who was so like the old
Basket but fortunately the new Basket does stand
on his legs in some indefinable way a litde the way
an Afghan hound stands on his although Basket the
new Basket is pure poodle, and I pointed this out to
Picasso when we and our dogs met on the street and
that did rather reconcile him to it.
It is rather interesting that the Frenchman said
have the same and the Spaniard said no don't have
the same. The Frenchman does realise the inevitability
of le roi est mort vive le roi but the Spaniard does not
recognise the inevitability of resemblances and con-
tinuation. He just does not but a Frenchman just does.
And now this Basket being a war-dog, that is living
in the country with us all the time in war-time is very
much a village dog and although the village spends
a great deal of time discussing whether he is more or
less beautiful than the last one, whether he is bigger
and whether he is more affectionate the children like
him but they treat him with less respect, they call
him Basket familiarly they do not call him Monsieur
Basket, there is that difference in their character, I
mean the character of this Basket and that Basket.
But for all that he is a very sweet Basket, any dog one
loves is a very sweet dog and poor Madame Pierlot
71


## p. 72 (#82) ##############################################

has just lost her Jimmie, and he was just the same age
as the other Basket.
Names are always interesting, and in this morning's
local paper I found that Mademoiselle Pierette
Davignon, ex-modiste has just died at eighty-one
years of age.
It is a very wonderful name that, Mademoiselle
Pierette Davignon.
It really takes a war to make you know a country,
I had only known Paris until 1914 and then I learned
to know France, and now once again living here all
winter in a provincial French town I once more
realise that a war brings you in contact with so
much and so many andatthe same time concentrates
your isolation. Undoubtedly that is what a war
does and is it unconsciously j3ne_ofjhe^ things that
makes wars happen, this thing.
After all human beings are like that. When they are
alone they want to be with others and when they are
with others they want to be alone and war in a kind of
way concentrating all this destroys it and intensifies it.
Well war does make one realise the march of
centuries and the succession of generations.
The nineteenth century wars were invented by the
citizens of the first French republic. They invented
a nation in arms, Napoleon rather spoiled it all, he
72


## p. 73 (#83) ##############################################

went back to pre-revolutionary fighting, did it very
well but after all it was eighteenth century and not
nineteenth century fighting, Wellington as a matter
of fact was more nineteenth century than Napoleon,
his Spanish campaign was much more nineteenth
century warfare than anything Napoleon did. And
so the French having invented nineteenth century
warfare and then lost it, it was completed by the
Americans in their civil war, they developed and
fixed it as a thing definite and complete and the 1914-
1918 war was as one might say just the end of the
series. It was just at the end of that war that Trotzky
defined the twentieth century war, which is neither
war nor peace, it was he that said it, he invented it
as the French republicans invented the nineteenth
century war but in inventing it they lost it. The
Nazis and the Soviets like Napoleon lost the thing
that was found and now England and France as the
Americans in the civil war, in 1939 have recreated
and realised the twentieth century war.
It is very interesting. They have found the secret
of not war and not peace but with it they will have
found the way to victory and to peace. And a
new Europe. Anyway that is the way I feel about it.
It is very interesting about England and France,
they have been completely conscious of each other
l 73


## p. 74 (#84) ##############################################

for such a very long time, sometimes in one way
sometimes in another way but always completely
conscious of each other.
Now it is war-time and the families who usually
spend their winter in cities are all spending them in
the country. We too.
Naturally they all study at home, particularly the
young girls, because at this time the French family
prefer that the young girls are under their own roof
and so everybody studies as best they can. They
naturally all want to learn English just now and
quite naturally we all talk about that. Some of these
girls have already passed their first baccalaureate
and some are now preparing for their second and in
this second they must translate a whole English thing
into French. They are given a choice of Hamlet,
Paradise Lost, some of the essayists and Emerson,
and they all without any hesitation chose Hamlet.
They like it best and they think it is the easiest
to do.
I was looking over Hamlet with one of them and
I was very much struck particularly in the ghost
scene, that all the words which are no longer in use
are French words completely French words, and I
could see why they all felt that it was easy to translate
because there they were all these completely French
74


## p. 75 (#85) ##############################################

words which were there for them and which the
English language to-day no longer uses.
I have often thought a lot about the words that
make the English language, and much as I have
thought about it, a war makes it even more definite,
as in this Hamlet.
Of course it was pure French and pure Saxon and
then less pure French and more Latin than French
until in the nineteenth century one quite has ceased
to feel the French in the English.
j
All this time of course the French and English have
always been keenly conscious of each other until the
nineteenth century, after the Napoleonic wars they
for quite a long time were not conscious of each
other, each one conducted the nineteenth century in
their own way until toward the end of the nine-
teenth century, when France did not find the century
particularly interesting and England was beginning
to refuse the twentieth century which was on the way,
France and England once more became livelily
conscious of each other which culminated in 1914-
1918.
Up to that time France was still interested in either
the nineteenth or the twentieth century and England
was still clinging to the nineteenth and refusing the
twentieth.
75


## p. 76 (#86) ##############################################

One might say that America which represented
the twentieth century and Russia which hoped for
the twentieth century did not interest either France
or England very much and the twentieth century as
conceived by these two countries did not please them,
did not please either the civilisation the logic or the
fashion of the French and did not please the civilisa-
tion, the idealism, or the rationality of the English
and so neither France nor England were really inter-
ested in the twentieth century. The 1914-1918 war
changed all this. These two countries realised that
the twentieth century should not get out of their
hands, that they had to make of it for the French a
thing logical civilised and fashionable and the
English had to manage it in their fashion, for after
all civilisation was in their hands and without them
the world would not be civilised and so they had to
come into the twentieth century and make it civilised
and here we are now.
You can see that the long line of English writers
every twenty-nine years a man of genius suffered
during this period when England refused the twen-
tieth century and that is most interesting because one
must never forget that the characteristic art product of
a country is its pulse and in England it is prose and
poetry.

I never get over the pleasure of the use of French
as it is used by anybody French. In this village we
have all shades of opinion and there is the Rosset
family very Catholic very conservative, not royalist
because they are republican but great believers in
tradition.
I remember one day it was the fourteenth of July
and just the year of the Front Commun, and I
happened to meet Monsieur Rosset and I said are you
going in town, and he said why should I go in town.
Well said I meekly it is the fourteenth of July.
The fourteenth of July he said, the fall of the
Bastille, quelle masquerade. I can give no impres-
sion of the word masquerade as it came out of him.
I realised what a feeble word the English word spelled
just the same really was.
And now Georges is aux armees, and the father
who adores Georges is very severe about how
inevitably you have to kill a million men to win a
war.
Georges writes to me, I hear just at this moment
that we are leaving to-morrow for the front that is
for a destination unknown. Let us guard our
courage and hope that very soon we will be again in
Bilignin and with our friends.
These are the typical French farmers.
77


## p. 78 (#88) ##############################################

And in the village of Bilignin we have had several
alerts. And there are two schools of thought.
Madame Votarey says that we are among moun-
tains, actually they are very high hills, we are in the
foothills of the French Alps and she says that it is
easy to lose your way in among mountains particularly
if you are in the air, so how could they find Bilignin.
Beside anyway she had made up her mind not to be
evacuated, and Madame Chanel says that since
airplanes must necessarily go here and there they
may easily sometime come here. At any rate adds
she reflectively men are fond of fighting. They are
unreasonable, if it rains too much they want to
fight, anything will make men fight. Anyway she
adds we are free in France.
Madame Pierlot is very much interested in the
way the men come back on leave looking so very
large and so very fat. She says in her eighty-eight
years it is the first war she has ever known that men
on leave come back looking so very large and so very
healthy and so very fat. The women whether it is
by contrast or because they have to work so hard
look very thin beside them.
The twentieth century wars might easily make men
healthy and fat because certainly the twentieth
century has made a great difference in the French
78


## p. 79 (#89) ##############################################

country, ours is a mountain village but there are no
poor, they are all comfortable and they all have some
luxuries, they all have bicycles they all have good
clothes for Sunday, they all have jam to put on their
bread, they all have plenty of chickens and ducks
which they do not sell but eat themselves and they all
have money in the bank, which they call argent
liquide. In the country here they say the milk pays
their current expenses, their calves pay taxes and
extra things like births marriages and deaths and the
wheat they eat, and the wine makes the money they
put in the bank and the potatoes they eat. In this
way they say anybody can be comfortable and you
have plenty of wine and meat and butter and bread
to eat. In this whole countryside there is only one
family not completely comfortable and they are not
poor but they are neglected, there are four small
children in the family all the same size but different
ages which happens when children are neglected.
The war brought them new clothes, the chanoine at
Belley wanted to do something and he gave them a
complete outfit, to go to school, they always go to
school of course but this time they went completely
new, even as they told me, to their underclothes,
they seem to think new clothes naturally come when
there is a war.
79


## p. 80 (#90) ##############################################

Even in Belley which is comparatively a city, it
having a population of about five thousand and it is
an important place, even there there are no poor.
They have a bazaar de charite once every two years
and the money they gather goes to general things,
rather than specific aid, there is a very large home for
the aged of the region but there are not many in it.
I was talking about this the other day to the Duke of
Clermont-Tonnerre, he was staying with Madame
Pierlot across the valley, and he said yes it is true.
He said in the part of the country he lives in, which is
quite a different kind of country, it was also true.
He could well remember when he was a boy that it
was not so then there were many very poor in the
country. I asked him if he thought the 1914 war had
something to do with the change, a little he said, it
did certainly accelerate it, but actually it had com-
menced before 1914. So it was the twentieth
century all alone that did it.
We have had here in the village a little girl and her
name is Helene Bouton, Helen Button, and I have
been kind of wondering just what a child's feeling
about war-time is. It is very interesting.
This is the way I have been feeling this, because
after all this war is not war, it is war-time.
Helen Button was her name and she lived in war-
80


## p. 81 (#91) ##############################################

time. She lived somewhere but the thing that is
important is that she lived during war-time.
There is a great deal of war-time in history and
Helen Button lived in it.
In this war-time the sun did shine it does do that
but Helen Button always knew that it was going to
rain before evening and it did do that, she knew it
by signs, she did not know what the signs were but
she knew by signs that it was going to rain.
In war-time children dogs and chickens are either
frightened or they are naughtier than usual, either one
or the other. And there are rather more of them
more of chickens dogs and children than before.
Helen Button knew this. And a dog was more
likely to kill a chicken in war-time than in peace-
time. Helen Button's dog did not kill one but he did
find a dead one and he brought it to her and laid
it down in front of her. Helen was worried that
they might think that he had killed a chicken, so she
and the cook secretly cooked and ate the chicken so
no one would suspect the dog. This could only
have happened to Helen in war-time.
Of course children do go in and out as they like a
great deal more in war-time than in peace-time for
there is not much use in just staying at home while it
is war-time.
M 81


## p. 82 (#92) ##############################################

Helen Button started out with her dog William.
As they were walking along suddenly William
stopped and was very nervous. He saw something
on the road and so did Helen. They neither of them
knew what it was at first and at last as they approached
very carefully they saw it was a bottle, a bottle
standing up right in the middle of the road. There
had been something in the botde but what, it looked
dark green or may be blue or black, and the bottle
was standing up in the middle of the road not lying
on its side the way a bottle on the road usually is.
William the dog and Helen the little girl went on.
They did not look back at the bottle. But of course
it was still there because they had not touched it.
That is war-time.
When Helen went out there were a great many
little boys on large bicycles about. The bicycles
were so tall that they could not get on the seats at all
but they were all over the country wriggling from
side to side to have their ride and when they saw any
water and some of the roads were under water they
went forward and back through the water to make it
splash. That was because their big brothers and their
fathers were gone away and that made so many more
Utile boys able to play.
Then Helen did know it was war-time.
82


## p. 83 (#93) ##############################################

Helen and her dog William were out every day and
almost every evening and they always saw some one.
They knew a boy named Emil who was a big boy
with very large eyes and a dog named Ellen. Ellen
the dog had been born in the country against which
they were fighting. Emil looked at his dog and
wondered if he could love him. The dog loved Emil
but could Emil love him.
As Helen and her dog William came along Emil's
dog Ellen was sniffing along the side of the road in
the sand and finally went sniffing up the bank.
Helen's dog William went sniffing too. Perhaps
there was game there, very likely because in war-
time men did not go shooting nobody hunted any-
thing only dogs and cats hunted in war-time, Emil
the boy with large eyes sighed about this. He said
dogs hunt in war-time but they do not get much,
anybody could see two or three dogs going together
to hunt and waiting to see if anybody saw them
because in peace-time of course they could not go
hunting. Then Emil said but cats in peace-time or
in war-time, they sit and watch and prey.
It was getting darker and beginning to rain and
Helen went one way and Emil went another way and
each one of their dogs went with the one who owned
him.
83


## p. 84 (#94) ##############################################

Helen had a grandmother and when she had been
the age of Helen there had been war-time. She
told Helen how one day she had a slice of bread and
there was very little bread to be had, but she did
have a good big slice and she was just commencing
eating it. A soldier came along an enemy soldier on
a horse, he stopped and got off his horse and not
roughly but he did, he took the slice of bread out of
her hand, she had just had one bite and he gave it to
his horse who ate it and he went away on his horse
and he did not say anything.
It was war-time now but Helen had bread when-
ever she wanted it and butter on it and she had jam
and honey and yet it was war-time.
School did not commence as soon as usual, it
always did commence as the days were shorter and
now the days were shorter and everything was
darker and darker and there were no lights and
Helen and her dog began to walk in the dark and
she could see the road in the dark and she knew it
was war-time. She did think about its being war-
time but she knew it was.
Helen Button thought that in war-time there was
not any difference between day and night. And she
was right. The nights were black and the days were
dark and there was no morning. Not in war-time.
84


## p. 85 (#95) ##############################################

So said Helen Button to herself, she did not talk
to the cook nor to her mother, she did not talk to
Emil the boy who had eyes that were so large, she
talked to herself. You do in war-time.
You talk to yourself about chestnuts and walnuts
and hazelnuts and beechnuts, you talk to yourself
about how many you find and whether they have
worms in them. You talk to yourself about apples
and pears and grapes and which kind you like best.
You just go on talking to yourself in war-time. You
talk to yourself about caterpillars but you never talk
to yourself about spiders or lizards, you talk to your-
self about dogs and cats and rabbits but not about bats
or mice or moths.
There are falling stars in war-time and Helen
Button saw them. Would stars come tumbling and
frighten every one. She saw some stars be blue and
some red, she said to herself one star is very red and
when that red star turns blue there will not be any
more war-time.
Helen knew that Emil's dog was born in the enemy
country. It had been given to Emil by some one
who came from there long before it was war-time.
One day, it was not at night it was in the morning,
Emil was not there but his dog Ellen was there and
Helen saw him. It was not true of course, it was
85


## p. 86 (#96) ##############################################

not true but Helen said to herself, I was watching
and the dog Ellen was changing and her fur turned
into large baggy trousers and her head turned into a
large shaggy head and it was a man, an enemy man,
yes it was said Helen to herself and I saw him and he
went down the road and I knew that it was a man,
who was an enemy and it was and I saw him.
She met Emil shortly after and his dog was with
him but it was not any longer morning and Helen
did not look at the dog Ellen, she looked at her own
dog William as if she knew him and she did and she
knew her own dog would come when she called him.
It was not long after that that every dog had to
have a muzzle on him. They used to talk about that
on the road. The men had had muzzles on dogs in the
country before when dogs might be mad and now it
was war-time and the dogs had to have them.
Helen Button listened to everybody and everybody
said something different about the reason why but
Helen did not say anything but she knew that she
knew the reason why.
Emil was just fascinating but so was Helen.
She knew just what was going to happen at least
her aunt Pauline did, her aunt was what they called
extra-lucid, that meant that she knew what was going
to happen, she always had but now in war-time it
86


## p. 87 (#97) ##############################################

was much more important. In peace time nothing
much did happen so there was no use in knowing
what was going to happen but in war-time anything
might happen so it was very necessary to know it.
What Helen Button liked best was about the cure
d'Ars, she liked all about him, she liked his not having
learned his lessons very well when he studied, she
liked his being kind to every one and she liked his
being a saint and she liked it that her grandmother
could remember him. But most she liked that he
had said that the day would come when the women
would plough the ground and plant the wheat but
the men would do the harvesting. And the women
she saw them they were sowing the wheat and the
men because the cure d'Ars had always known every-
thing they would be back again to do the harvest-
ing, it was war-time but they would be back again.
And then she was a little strange when she heard
that the nuns in the cities did not wear coiffes any
more, they could not and get gas masks over them,
so they could not wear them any more and the cure
d'Ars had predicted that too. He had said the time
would come when the sisters in the hospitals would
not wear their coiffes, and of course but still nobody
really believed him but now the time had come, they
were not wearing them, but and this was consoling
87


## p. 88 (#98) ##############################################

every one, he had said that all this would only last
for a time a very short time just long enough to turn
an omelette. And this was comforting.
Helen Button loved to listen to her aunt Pauline,
they called her The Pauline and a good many people
did believe her, but really Helen never thought
about whether it was so or not. She liked to just
say it to Emil when she saw him and she knew saying
it made her fascinating.
So Helen knew when the war was going to end
and when there would be no more war-time and
Helen knew that this did make her fascinating.
Her Aunt Pauline did really know everything.
She knew when any enemy was going to be dead,
she knew how often a clock would strike, she knew
who was not going to eat eggs, she knew who was
going to buy a hat, she knew everything.
Helen Button went out with her dog and the moon
was shining.
Helen should not have been out when the moon
was sinning, she knew she should not. She should
only have been out when it was dark because if the
moon shone it was night not just dark. There she
was though and automobiles came quickly in the
bright moon-light, they came slowly in the dark
because their lights were green and blue not white.
88


## p. 89 (#99) ##############################################

The automobile came on, it went over William
and Helen screamed and William was down and then
he was up and then away he went, oh how he did go.
Helen went on calling and William came back
crawling.
Oh dear where was Emil with eyes so big that he
could see everything.
Helen and William did get home and that after all
was something.
So war-time just went on being war-time and
after that William the dog had a stiff neck but it did
not last long he was soon very well but he was always
scared when he saw a light and particularly scared
when he suddenly saw the moon through the mist
and it does look green.
Emil was not an orphan. He had a horse. There
were not many of them, most of them had been
taken to go to the war. Emil's horse was a heavy
one the kind that pulled things, that is perhaps the
reason they did not take him, he went ahead too
slowly even for war-time.
So it was left to pull things and one day Helen
met it, it was pulling a wagon and on the wagon was
an animal, nobody had ever seen any animal like it
before, it was enormous and it was dead.
The horse pulling the wagon did not mind nor
N 89


## p. 90 (#100) #############################################

Emil but Emil's dog Ellen minded very much, very
much indeed.
The enormous animal did not have a tail and it did
not have any ears. It was an enormous animal and
it was war-time.
Helen did not really see it but she told herself about
it. She said, dear me.
Nobody knew where the wagon and the horse
went, nobody ever does in war-time.
When Helen Button went to sleep she did not
dream. Then all of a sudden she began to dream.
She dreamed that it was war-time.
When she woke she did not get up, it was war-time
and nobody just said to her get up but bye and bye
she did get up and she went out. After a while she
stood perfectly still and listened.
She thought she heard it but did she.
She listened and listened. It was war-time and so
she listened and listened.
She heard weather, she heard water she heard
snow, she heard water everywhere, it was that kind
of weather. She heard snow around she very nearly
heard the moon and she heard the rain and she heard
the mountains.
There might be school and Helen might go to
school but she did not. Nobody said she should and
90


## p. 91 (#101) #############################################

indeed so few went that any day there might not
be a school and so it was anyday and it was war-
time. So every day she went out and the snow came
and the snow melted and water was everywhere
and dogs hunted game not Helen's dog but other
dogs and these dogs stood and waited until every-
body was out of sight and then they hunted game.
Men could not go hunting but dogs could. That is
war-time.
One day Helen and her dog and Emil and his dog
met going up and up a hill.
They went up and they saw a man there. He was
not an old man, he was a young one and it was war-
time and seeing a young man in ordinary clothes was
startling. This man up there on that hill, there was
snow and water there, had a spy glass and he was
looking way off through it.
Is he said Helen Yes he is said Emil.
And he was and they said, Helen and Emil, shall
we and Emil said yes. Now said Helen. Yes said
Emil. And how said Helen. I know him said
Emil.
Emil went up to the man. He said to him. You
are an enemy. I am not, said the man. If you are
not what is your name said Emil. My name is
Henry said the man.
9i


## p. 92 (#102) #############################################

There they stood and the snow in the fields and
the water splashing and the man in wooden shoes,
looking through his spy-glass at something.
What should they do.
It was really war-time.
They all went away always looking behind.
Very soon then there was nobody anywhere.
This is war-time.
Helen did not know why but this was the first
thing in war-time that had made her cry.
It was not long after that Emil went away and his
dog too. Whether to the war or not Helen never
knew.
There are so many people who go away in war-
time and there are always so many everywhere in
war-time here there and everywhere.
So now it was still war-time and Helen began to go
to school too.
So for her war-time was over.
So this is the twentieth century. I have been
thinking a lot about centuries. I think centuries are
like men, they begin as children begin simple and
hopeful then they go through that period that
Doctor Osier used to call the senseless age, boys of
eleven to seventeen, and then they go through
their period of becoming civilised and then the
92


## p. 93 (#103) #############################################

century more or less settles down, becomes as the
French say range that is civilised and the work is
over.
I have a kind of feeling that every century is like
that, certainly the nineteenth century was and the
twentieth, the other centuries probably were too.
What is true in one century is pretty certainly true of
all of them.
So here we are in the twentieth century at the
moment when the century begins to be ready for
civilising.
In the early part of the century, the century like all
adolescents and sometimes it lasts considerably
longer, long to get away from the family, the real
tamily and the idea of the family.
Every adolescent has that dream every century has
that dream every revolutionary has that dream, to
destroy the family.
In France, well the dream even among the
adolescent intellectuals, the violent revolutionaries,
the adolescent communists, it really is not very real.
After all every Frenchman knows that he is destined
to be a pere de familla a father of a family, even if he
has neither wife nor child being a pere de famille is
his manifest destiny. Every Frenchman will inevit-
ably speak of himself and his comrades, nous peres de
93


## p. 94 (#104) #############################################

famille, it is really the only way that a Frenchman can
realise life and so although adolescence and intel-
lectualism demand that he believes in a world not
based upon a family unit, in his heart every French-
man knows that that is all there is to it, a family and
himself a father of a family.
It is interesting that in the country in almost every
village there is a man who has not married, either his
mother lived too long and he never got married, or
he just did not get married because he was off some-
where and did not get back, anyway for one reason
or another not uncommonly in a village there is
one man who never got married. Usually even if
the mother did live so long and so possessed her son
that he grew quite old unmarried, nevertheless when
his mother dies some widow marries him but every
now and then and very often one in almost any
village is unmarried.
Nobody can really take him seriously, they very
often call him familiarly, a hen, and most of the
time he does go a little funny, he stands sadly around
and looks at the women who never became his wife
and once in a while he goes quite queer, as recently
in a village not far from here, one day he was about
fifty-five and he never had been married, he shot a
woman just any woman as he saw her at a distance.
94


## p. 95 (#105) #############################################

No man who had ever been married could have
done that, manifestly not.
There are of course some women not often more
than one in a village who has not married, but she is
not so likely in France to go funny, of course there
are always animals, and animals can become a family,
to a Frenchwoman, but not to a Frenchman.
In our village there is a woman like that and she
loves her dog and the last time it was a blind one,
she and her old father and the dog born blind did
and do make a family and even when her father dies
she will still have a family, because some animal
will be treated by her as a member of a family.
Madame Chaboux told me a story about that.
It is perfectly natural in France to say that a little
dog was sitting on the lap of his mother. In fact
French people are quite convinced French is the
only language which has a real baby language for
dogs, I remember once a long discussion ending up
triumphantly with, in English how could you say,
come chien chien come to your mamere.
You do not say to a dog come to your father, a
Frenchman but you do say come to your mother, a
Frenchwoman.
So Madame Chaboux was in her country in the
Jura and she went to a concert given for the soldiers
95


## p. 96 (#106) #############################################

and the country people were all there and next to her
was sitting a country woman and on her lap was a
little dog. Madame Chaboux in telling the story
said quite naturally, next to me a little dog was sitting
on the lap of its mother, the little dog was very
discreet, when there was applause he woke up and
barked a bit but otherwise he was quite quiet. It
was announced that the most famous flutist in
France happened to be in the country and he had
offered to play for the soldiers. He came onto the
stage and began to arrange his flute. The mother of
the little dog a little uneasy turned to Madame
Chaboux and said, pourvu que mon petit chien aime
la flute, pourvu. It is to be hoped my little dog will
like the flute, it is to be hoped.
That is the French way, no conviction, a hope and
that is all.
The French do love to say a thing and say it com-
pletely.
That is the reason that once a thing is completely
named it does no logger worry them. Now the
word une guerre des nerfs, has become a part of their
speech, it has no longer any effect upon their nerves.
That is their logic fashion and civilisation.
So naturally although the French do have as every
country seems to need to have that adolescent intel-
96


## p. 97 (#107) #############################################

lectualism of the negation of the family in their hearts
it is not so. That is one of the reasons that French
people are not snobs.
No matter what is the origin of any man, no
matter what he has achieved, it never enters his
head not to return to the family, the simple country-
man can have children in any walk of life and there is
no complication, the well dressed man comes to his
home where his people are roughly clad and as they
were and nobody feels that there is any discrepancy,
never at any time.
It is of course also true of the army, anybody can
be a simple soldat as anybody can be an officer. It is
a question of metier, of a profession, and not of class.
Here in the town, the notary, the lawyer, the
banker are all simple soldiers, the son of the butcher
is an officer, it is all a question of profession it is not
a matter of class.
Pierre Leyris a young writer and neighbor of ours
in the country here was speaking of that the other
day. He is not very strong and so he is an auxiliare
and not in the active army but during mobilisation
they were mobilised as a company of auxiliares to
be used in helping in the machinery of mobilisation.
He enjoyed his short military career, he enjoyed his
comrades they all had a good time together, and then
o 97

mobilisation over, they were demobilised. He said
that was a dreadful day. When they put on their
civilian clothes it was all different, they looked at
each other differently they knew what each one was
and when they had been all together, nobody knew
or cared.
I remember a French sister in a convent speaking of
that too. She said the costume and the coiffe, the
coiffe that the cure d'Ars said they would take off for
long enough to turn an omelette and which many of
them have had to take off to put on the gas masks,
well she said we never know what any sister comes
from and what her background is unless by accident
we are in the parloir seeing our relations and she is
in the parloir seeing hers. Then they could know
but I imagine they are not supposed to notice.
We saw the Pere Abbe of the abbaye royale
d'Hautecombe yesterday, sixteen of his twenty-six
monks are mobilised, and most of them as simple
soldiers. One of them one of the older ones is an
aumonier, a priest to an aviation division. He is
immensely pleased with himself, he not alone has an
automobile and a chauffeur at his disposition but
he also has an airplane and an aviator. There was a
charming twinkle in the Pere Abbess eye when he
told us that.

Madame Giroud herself the widow of a general
told us about her family, every ten years they reunite
all the family that is in existence and at the last the two
most striking members were one of the great judges
of France and the driver of a country hearse. But
they were all family and they had a good dinner a
most excellent dinner all of them together.
Madame Giroud told us of her great aunt, she was
one of the beauties of this country and a very import-
ant person. One day not very long ago Madame
Giroud was in the country where they all came from
and she met an old woman and they talked together.
Ah said the old woman Madame you do remember
your great aunt. Ah yes said Madame Giroud well
said the old woman, I know something about her
that nobody else knows. When she was young quite
young and very beautiful a soldier passed by. And
your greataunt gave birth to a pair of still-born
twins very little ones and she buried them under a
pear tree the two of them.
Madame Giroud admitted that ever since a pear
tree did give her a funny feeling.
This year as every year they gather the grapes and
make the wine, they always think there will be
none as in this country everything is against the wine,
the late frosts, hail, mildew and not enough late sun-
99


## p. 100 (#110) ############################################

shine, but they always have a crop all the same. This
year as always they had one, quite a large one and the
French like their land are economical and generous,
everything has to go into it and a good deal comes out
of it, and they always have to celebrate it, faire part,
as it reads in their announcements of funerals wedding
and births, in this country they always celebrate it
by something called ramequin, it is like a welsh
rarebit, only instead of beer and cheese, it is made of
white wine, eggs and cheese, and everybody keeps
stirring it with their very large piece of bread.
In the neighborhood here the other day they had
not agreed about something so one of the neighbors
was not invited. All the others were gathered
together to make the ramkin, it is the only cooking
any Frenchman who is a father of a family and not a
professional cook ever does. The men were making
the ramkin on the stove, it was a dark night, the
neighbor climbed on the roof and sat on the chimney
and so the smoke went back down the chimney and
smoked the ramkin, the cronies thought it was the
wind and began again, the man on the roof lifted
himself until he heard them say now it is on and
then down he sat again upon the chimney, and
spoiled the ramkin, it was not until some time after
that the unfortunate cooks found out why.

So the most striking thing about France is the
family, and the terre, the soil of France. Revolu-
tions come and revolutions go, fashions come and
fashions go, logic and civilisation remain and with it
the family and the soil of France.
They are so reasonable about that land, of course it
has no value without men, and of course men cannot
exist without family.
The family, any family has naturally the quality
of the concentration of isolation. That is what
makes a family, that is what makes war, so much war,
it is that concentration of isolation. And the French
who do not want war live through war calmly,
because after all it is the concentration of isolation
which is a family in peace as well as in war.
As a cultivated earth has nothing brutal or really
cruel about it so the Frenchman is neither brutal
nor cruel. They invented the word sadism but their
sadism has to do with the passions and the passions
have nothing to do with the earth or with the family,
that is like revolutions and other things a thing
apart.
One of the things that is very evident in France is
that children are never punished not even much
corrected. They from the beginning are French
that is logical civilised and have a sense of fashion
101


## p. 102 (#112) ############################################

and a complete realisation of the facts of life. Any
French child can thoroughly understand anything.
The one rare time I ever saw a boy crying was one
day down by the quays in Paris.
The quays in Paris have never changed, that is to
say they look different but the life that goes on there
is always the same. It was only last year that I
really got to know them, I had put my car in a
garage below Notre Dame and every morning and
every evening I went the length of the quays for-
ward and back. I found that going down below near
the water I could let my dogs loose because we crossed
no streets and then I found that the life there below
was very pleasant, it had nothing whatever to do
with the life of a city, that is one of the characteristic
things of the French, the city and country the country
and city are not separated. Everybody in the city
has relations in the country and everybody in the
country has relations in the city and everybody in the
city expects to return to something in the country all
the employees of the state all policemen all workmen
of all sorts, in fact practically everybody even the
shopkeepers do expect to retire eventually to the
country, that is where inevitably you live when you
no longer have to work for a living, when you have a
pension when you have saved some thing and you
102


## p. 103 (#113) ############################################

grow vegetables and you build yourself a little house
and you hope that money won't change so much but
that you can live on what you have. Anyway you
can always have vegetables and rabbits and chickens
and that is always something.
Of course money has done a lot of changing but
there is always the hope that it will stay put sometime.
Anyway the French people never take money very
seriously, they save it certainly they horde it very
carefully but they know really that it has no very
great permanence. That is the reason they all want
a place in the country. Lots of people we know
have tried to buy a house in this neighborhood and
they are always surprised that nobody wants to sell,
neither the peasants or the small people or the bigger
people. But as they all say if we sell our home what
will we have for it, money, and what is the use of
that money, money goes and after it is gone then
where are we, beside we have all we want, what can
we do with money except lose it, money to spend is
not very welcome, if you have it and you try to
spend it, well spending money is an anxiety, saving
money is a comfort and a pleasure, economy is not
a duty it is a comfort, avarice is an excitement, but
spending money is nothing, money spent is money
non-existent, money saved is money realised,
103


## p. 104 (#114) ############################################

even as it did the other day in the village it got
burned up.
There was a fire in an isolated barn down in the
valley and it was in the day-time and the locksmith
who is the head of the fire-brigade was trying to
put out the fire but as the barn was full of hay it was
pretty hopeless.
The barn belonged to one man and the hay
belonged to another man and everybody seemed
rather philosophical about it all, the barn was old
and it had been a good barn for hay and the owner of
the hay had plenty more and then suddenly some-
body remembered that there was a lean-to that
belonged to still somebody else and vaguely some-
body remembered that he had said once that he had
left things there, so somebody went off to find the
man who owned the lean-to. He was not busy but
he did not want to come but finally he was induced to
come and in the meanwhile they had gone into the
lean-to, and there they found some clothes and some
bedding and in a jug forty thousand francs.
When the owner was confronted with this he said
yes, it was his pension, he was a widower, he had
plenty to eat from his land, they gave him this
money, he had to go in town for it but as he had no
use for it he left it there in the lean-to.
104


## p. 105 (#115) ############################################

What he did with it when they finally gave it to
him I do not know, but I suppose he left it some-
where else.
French people do not like to spend money it
worries them, they take luxuries naturally, if you
have them they are not luxuries and if you do not
have them they still are not luxuries.
And so on the banks of the Seine down by the
water there is no city life at all, it is an easy life and
each person lives it for himself.
So one day there I saw a boy about thirteen years
of age a stout well-set up and comfortably dressed
boy sitting by the water-side, next to him was a
woman evidently not his mother but a relation and
there they sat. Large tears were rolling down his
cheeks. What is it, I asked her, oh she said sorrow,
but it will pass. He has failed in his examinations, but
it will pass. And quite impersonally she sat by and
indeed it was sorrow but as she said, sorrow passes.
It is a queer life down there by the river. One
day I was coming along and there were two men,
one of them had found a high hat and also some
orange flowers which he had pinned on the hat, and
as they came along, the one presented the other to
every one, he is my brother, he said of the other.
The barges always grow flowers and the men
P 105


## p. 106 (#116) ############################################

always come down with mimosa in their hand and
disappear somewhere with it, and there are card-
board beds under the bridges, cardboard apparently
is good against the cold anyway they use it, and the
women wash their clothes and the men fish there
and artists paint there and everybody minds their
own business. They talk and grumble mostly to
themselves but nobody fights with anybody else.
So children are never harshly treated in France.
A child in France is a thing of value, it is not a
treasure Init it is like anydung^that belongs to the
earth-it hasi a value and a valuable thing is always well
taken care of, and the French use everytlung^uTtney
abuse_nQthing.
So the twentieth century did need France as a
background. France might play with the idea of the
destruction of the family as the beginning and end of
everything but it could never really convince any
Frenchman and so France was a background for the
beginning of the twentieth century, it had had its
one real effort to believe that the family and the
things the family holds in its hands and walks on and
eats and drinks and which belong to that family, they
had their try-out of trying not to believe in this in
the beginning of the nineteenth century in the first
^rench revolution, but it really was not interesting.
106


## p. 107 (#117) ############################################

Wars yes and excitement yes, but really not interest-
ing. There is no logic to it, no civilisation to it and
no fashion.
So when the twentieth century was going to start
in to try it out all over again, the Frenchmen were
very content to be in it but not of it.
In France the family life is never so much a family
life as in vacation. The family is always the family
but during vacations it is an extended family and that
is exhausting.
A Frenchman once told me that he was haunted it
was his obsession what he called vacation weather.
I said it is just summer weather, no he said it has a
kind of weight to it that is not summer but vacation
weather.
In every country house all the in-laws come and
all their children and all their servants, in-laws only
visit each other in winter, they visit a great deal and
they all eat together somewhere at least once a week
but in the vacation they live together.
Then came the twentieth century with its auto-
mobiles particularly after the war, the French family
lived less together in vacations because they naturally
moved around more. They all pretty well concluded
that this was even more exhausting than all living
together and not as healthy for children and every one.
107


## p. 108 (#118) ############################################

Getting in and out of trains was better because trains
are always stopping but automobiles just kept going.
Now in this new war all the country is filled with all
the relations living together but it is not vacation
weather, it is not even vacation so everybody is
happier beside that they cannot move around even
| in trains so it is not so exhausting. It is a permanent
• residence and that changes everything. In-laws are
now a permanency and so except for the very often
repeated statement that some cousin is a woman
really utterly wearisome, and a French family is
always of the same mind, they all find the same
person the most tiresome, and there are always the
certain amount of trouble about mother-in-laws,
and daughter-in-laws, but all this is very much
softened by the son and husband being away at the
war. And many financial arrangements which were
inevitable because of troubles between daughter-in-
laws and widowed mother-in-laws rest in abeyance.
And that makes everything easier.
In France letters are not shared. Each one has
their own letter. Any member of any class in
France will say I have had no news but my mother
has, or I have had no news but my son has. Well
said I once in astonishment do they not read you
what is in their letter, I was going to say do they not
108


## p. 109 (#119) ############################################

show you the letter but I knew instinctively that that
would not do. Oh yes is the answer, he or she reads
me what he or she chooses.
Everything is private and personal in France and
at the same time a family is always together. Even
in the midst of the war letters are not shared. As
my old servant Helene once said, no Madame it is
not a secret but one does not tell it.
I really have never known Paris in the midst of a
declaration of war. Wars always take place in
vacation time and in vacation weather, so one is not
in Paris. Paris is always there, at least we in the
country suppose so although at such a time we are
not very conscious of its existence, the beginning of
war is so occupying where you are, that even Paris
is not there. Such is the concentration of isolation
which is war.
Paris is there and gradually even here quite far
away one begins to know that it is there.
I have never known Paris in the beginning of a war,
I have known Paris during the war not this time but
the last time, this time I only knew it for half a day.
I have however known Paris since the beginning of
the twentieth century until now, known it pretty well.
When I first knew Paris again since childhood in
1900 and then only on vacation France meant Paris,
109


## p. 110 (#120) ############################################

France meant Paris and its immediate surroundings.
The Paris which was France as I knew it then was
completely republican.
I knew an American Mrs. Dawson, I met her in
England and she said she had abandoned Paris after
1870. She said the manners of the French as repub-
licans were not the delightful manners of Paris as an
Empire. To be sure everybody in the republic was
addressed as Monsieur and Madame. Even the
butcher boy quite young would say bon-jour
Madame to our servant and she would equally
seriously bon-jour Monsieur to him although he
was only fifteen. I do not know whether during
the empire this was true. At any rate although
there are always monarchists and imperialists in
France, most unexpected ones sometimes, actually
they in their hearts pretty much all of them are
republicans and want a republic, because they know
that the family is so strong in France that the heredi-
tary principle should be kept out of the government,
it just should.
Beside the republic so far has pretty well done what
they all think a government should do, let them
alone, protected them, on the whole, from the
enemy, and though it costs a good deal, this govern-
ment, it might cost more if it were another govern-
no


## p. 111 (#121) ############################################

ment, and no piece of it gets so well established that
it can go too far in any direction. And so as govern-
ments go the third republic is not so bad. It might
be worse, it might be better, but it is not too bad.
In Paris around 1900-1914 the men were elegant
and had almost more beauty of elegance than the
women. When we came to Paris the men wearing
their silk hats on the side of their head and leaning
heavily on their cane toward the other side making a
balance, the heavy head the heavy hand on the cane
were the elegance of Paris. The women were plain,
fashionable more than elegant in contrast with the
men. As the century progressed the war came.
The horizon blue and the black uniforms of the
aviators continued the tradition of French elegance
among the men. The women for a while did lose
fashion and slowly then the men lost their elegance
and the women regained their fashion and then they
were no longer plain they were pretty and for a
while, it was another ideal. After this war the men
very likely will regain elegance and the women
fashion and elegance. It is all very exciting.
Flowers and fruits were very much rarer in the
beginning of the century than now. In those days
flowers and fruits were rare and being rare were very
elegant.
in


## p. 112 (#122) ############################################

They were very carefully cultivated to look well
and be well in relation to the thing near which they
were to be placed, either people or things, they had
nothing to do with out-of-doors, they had entirely
to do with indoors, and the arrangement of the fruits
and flowers were traditional elegant and fashionable.
I can remember the horror of our Bretonne servant
in Palma when we used to bring in armfuls of
flowers and put them all over the house. Now any
French person can bear flowers anywhere and in any
quantity with equanimity but not then. It was
also true of fruits. Fruits were a wonderful size,
almost always with a design stencilled upon them
when they were in the act of growing and very
expensive. No one was ever allowed to touch them.
There were only these very wonderful fruits and
ordinary apples practically nothing else and these
ordinary apples were always wormy. Since then
fruits in the smallest provincial town are to be found
in great abundance, everybody eats fruit and fruit
is really no longer a thing to admire or to have as
an adjunct to an elegant table. The same is true
with flowers. Flowers are now bought in great
bunches and anybody within reason can have all
they want. So now flowers are almost arranged in
many homes in the English manner lots of flowers
112


## p. 113 (#123) ############################################

everywhere and the new interest in flowers is to
arrange them to give an effect of violence, of activity,
of strangeness. Gradually that is producing its own
elegance.
I was talking to Madame Giroud, she remembers
everything and I asked her what seemed to her the
most startling difference between the France of her
youth the Nineteenth century and the France of
to-day. She said undoubtedly the difference in
dress of the people living not in cities but in the
country. Not alone the girls but the women in
villages and country towns all dress well, all clean
themselves very much more.
I know that I was much taken with the short
sleeves short dresses as being an enormous incentive
to personal cleanliness. There was a very great
difference between before and after the war about
that. It was true of the younger women and even
true of the older women.
On the other hand except the introduction of
electric light the inside of the houses in the villages
and in the country have not changed much. Of
course the existence of electric light in itself made
things different because any one can see everything
more clearly. Then young men have changed and
are athletic and clean but as they grow older they
Q 113


## p. 114 (#124) ############################################

tend to be more as they were. The women keep
up the standard and that has its great influence upon
the children. The men less. I am now speaking of
the country and not of the cities. One of the most
important things in the city was the introduction of
central heating. The houses the shops in Paris and
in the other large cities suddenly became very hot.
That had to do naturally with the change in fashion
of the women the short sleeves the short skirts the
lack of underclothes the thinness of the stockings,
and as France makes the fashions for everybody the
central heating created in the cities in France made
the styles. The styles went with the Americanisation
of Europe so pronounced immediately after the war,
hygienes, bath-tubs, and sport.
Later on and until just now there have been per-
sistent attempts to get back or forward to styles that
cover more, and until now they have been resisted
because the conditions that produced the post-war
fashions more or less persisted. Gradually though
the desire to spend money slackened, it was more
difficult to make money and therefore there began a
tendency to save it. In the old nineteenth century
France you were always supposed to live on your
last year's income never on your current income.
And now every one was living in France on this
114


## p. 115 (#125) ############################################

year's income or next year's income, they were living
on the instalment plan, in short they were not being
themselves. And slowly they were beginning resent-
ing this tendency, it came from all classes this resist-
ance and the fashions went with it the effort to
re-establish more covering to the body longer skirts
more durable clothes.
Now there is war, the houses in Paris are not
centrally heated any more. In many apartment
houses you heat yourself as you can. Many people
like ourselves are staying in the country with the
boulets fire of France which I have not seen since
1900 and wood fires to help and naturally woollen
stockings and other things accompany this and
fashions are changing. The darkness has a great
deal to do with everything. Madame Giroud always
tells me you do not know what these villages were in
the old days and even now although the roads are
dark the houses and the barns are lighted electrically
inside, all the streets are dark but the shops are bright
inside. So although they look mediaeval outside they
do not feel mediaeval inside. So even when it is black
outside in the twentieth century it is brightly lighted
inside. Which was not true of the nineteenth century.
The boulets fires of France the round walnuts of
pressed coal that were in all houses in the beginning
115


## p. 116 (#126) ############################################

of the twentieth century quite entirely ceased to
exist even in the country, the grates that were put in
to the fireplace and balanced by a bit of brick and
filled with the walnut coal that gave out a steady
small heat and never really seemed to change night
or day were not seen any more. And now there is
1939 and war and everybody wants their boulets fire
back again. We have one. We found the grates
still in the local shops with the same curly design as
one we found in the garret of this house which dates
from we do not know when. Those in the shops
are of exactly the same design which shows how dead
boulets fires had been.
And so a century is made of one hundred years and
a hundred years is not so long. Anybody can know
somebody who remembers somebody else and makes
it go back one hundred years. If it cannot be done in
two generations it can be done easily done in three.
And so one hundred years is not so long.
It is rather a worry that our civilisation if you think
of it in the form of three generations making a
century does not take many generations to begin.
A century is one hundred years. Every century
has a beginning and a middle and an ending. Every
century is like the life of any one, the life of any
nation, that is to say it begins that is it has a childhood
116


## p. 117 (#127) ############################################

it has an adolescence it has an adult life, it has a
middle life an older life and then it ends.
The nineteenth century did all this, the twentieth
century is doing it. I imagine any century does.
It begins as a child begins trailing its clouds of
glory from the century which has just been. Of
course the twentieth century did that. Only a small
part of those in the commencing of the twentieth
century started it as a twentieth century and not a
left over nineteenth century. It began in uncertainty,
it walked with difficulty, it rather just crept along.
And then slowly it went through its adolescence
and then the world war came, and that made every-
body know it was not the nineteenth century but the
twentieth century.
I asked Madame Pierlot, she had been raised in the
country, she was a provincial, she had never been to
Paris, she had been the wife of a military attache" at
various capitals and then just in the beginning of the
century she went to Paris as a woman of forty. I
said to her how did you feel about it. Well she
said I was disappointed in it. But why, well she
said I thought it was not as concentrated as embas-
sadorial circles in other countries, I found French
people in Paris, sophisticated and not very exciting.
And then, she added, I found that Parisians were
117


## p. 118 (#128) ############################################

much more interesting when you had them in the
country. I ceased to see them in Paris I had them
come to stay with me in the country, and then I
knew that Parisians were interesting.
She then went on to tell me of when she first went
to Paris she went to a dinner and sat next to Anatole
France. After a little while he said Madame you are
not a Parisian you have always lived in the provinces.
Yes she said. That he said is admirable, continue,
live in Paris but always remain provincial.
And so the century only slowly began to come of
age, the war was a struggle and it made the twentieth
century self-conscious. Everybody in it knew the
twentieth century for what it was.
France had not really been interested in the
twentieth century England had refused the twentieth
century, and now the world war made them both
make up their minds that the twentietla century was
there, it was going through the agony through which
all adolescence has to go, it was suffering as all
adolescents suffer and there it was it was the twentieth
century.
And France and England after the war began to
feel a little that the twentieth century would have to
get civilised. It would have to go through that
period of revolution that every young person goes
118


## p. 119 (#129) ############################################

through, when they think that systems will not be
systems but something else, when every one is
certain that they can reform everybody if they only
go the right way to work at it.
This was the first war period, a period of fashion
without style, of systems with disorder, of reforming
everybody which is persecution, and of violence
without hope. All this is natural after adolescence
before the process of civilising of recognising the
right of every one not to be reformed which comes
when people become adult.
And now France and England are hoping to do this
thing now it is almost forty years old the century and
it was time it was becoming civilised time it was
beginning to be grown up, time to settle down to
middle age and a pleasant life and the enjoyment of
ordinary living.
So this book is dedicated to France and England.
France who was the background of all who were
excited and determined and created by the twentieth
century but who herself was not at the time enor-
mously interested. France really prefers civilisation
to tumultuous adolescence, France prefers that the
adolescent learns reserve and logic and civilisation
and fashion as he emerges out of adolescence, France

felt instinctively as not an end in itself but as a pro-
gression toward the state of being civilised. And
England who like a boy who has not gone to school
because his people did not believe in any of the schools
that were then existing and who then considerably
older does go to school and very quickly catches up
and passes the others who have been at school from
the beginning because England did refuse the twen-
tieth century, did not believe it was really there
thought everybody had made a mistake except
themselves, they who knew it was still the nineteenth
century.
And now they know.
This book is dedicated to France and England who
are to do what is the necessary thing to do, they are
going to civilise the twentieth century and make it
be a time when anybody can be free, free to be
civilised and to be.
The century is now forty years old, too old to do
what it is told.
It is old enough to like to live quietly and well,
to go to heaven or to hell as they like, to know that
to live as they please is pleasanter than to be told.
So this is what England and France are going to do
and this book is dedicated to them because I want them
to do what they are going to do. Thank you.
